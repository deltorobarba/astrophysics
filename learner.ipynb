This can be shown using the following theorem: Theorem: The metric entropy of any hypothesis class with VC dimension d is at most d. This theorem tells us that the complexity class PSPACE, which contains all problems that can be solved by a polynomial space Turing machine, is contained in the complexity class EXPTIME, which contains all problems that can be solved by an exponential time Turing machine.

First, and maybe most naturally, we can equip the set $\\mathcal{S}\\left(\\mathbb{C}^d\\right)$ with the (for convenience scaled) trace norm $I_i / 2$. This allows us to measure the difference between two quantum states $\\rho, \\sigma \\in$ $S\\left(\\mathbb{C}^d\\right)$ via the trace distance $\\left.\\left.\\|\\rho-\\sigma\\|_1 / 2=\\operatorname{tr} \\| \\rho-\\sigma\\right]\\right] / 2$.

        "  * The trace norm (also known as the nuclear norm) is a specific case of Schatten p-norm when p=1. It's the sum of singular values of a matrix. Sometimes, in the context of regularizing machine learning models, these norms are considered to constrain the learning capacity of the model. The trace of the Fisher Information Matrix can give a measure of the average sensitivity of the log-likelihood to parameter changes.\n",

Squared Euclidean distance is also a divergence, specifically a special case of a Bregman divergence for a certain choice of generating function when the generating convex function is a quadratic function -  In this context, it represents a measure of divergence between two points in the space.\n",

        "* [Mahalanobis distance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahalanobis_distance) is a measure of the distance between a point P and a distribution D, used in multivariate anomaly detection, classification on highly imbalanced datasets and one-class classification. If each of these axes is re-scaled to have unit variance, then the Mahalanobis distance corresponds to standard Euclidean distance in the transformed space. The Mahalanobis distance is thus unitless and scale-invariant, and takes into account the correlations of the data set. In statistics, the covariance matrix of the data is sometimes used to define a distance metric called Mahalanobis distance. The Mahalanobis distance does not satisfy the triangle inequality because it can be zero even if the two points are not the same. This can happen if the covariance matrix is singular. It is often used in multivariate anomaly detection, classification, and regression. [Mahalanobis distance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahalanobis_distance) is useful when dealing with variables measured in different scales (so the units of measure become standardized) and also, in order to avoid correlation issues between these variables.\n",
