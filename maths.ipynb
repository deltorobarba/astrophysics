        "\"There are (at least) two possible ways to formulate precisely (i.e. mathematically) elementary\n",
        "QM. The eldest one, historically speaking, is due to von Neumann in essence, and is formulated using the language of Hilbert spaces and the spectral theory of unbounded operators. A more recent and mature formulation was developed by several authors in the attempt to solve quantum field theory problems in mathematical physics. It relies on the theory of abstract algebras (*-algebras and C* -algebras) that are built mimicking the operator algebras defined and studied, again, by von Neumann (nowadays known as W* -algebras or von Neumann algebras), but freed from the Hilbert-space structure. The core result is the celebrated GNS theorem (after Gelfand, Najmark and Segal), that we will prove in Chap. 14. The newer formulation can be considered an extension of the former one, in a very precise sense that we shall not go into here, also by virtue of the novel physical context it introduces and by the possibility of treating physical systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom, i.e. quantum fields. In particular, this second formulation makes precise sense of the demand for locality and covariance of relativistic quantum field theories, and allows to extend quantum field theories to a curved spacetime.\"\n",

The theorem states that the distribution function is constant along the trajectories of the system. That is, the total phase space volume is conserved.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Mixed State**: A mixed state describes a statistical mixture of different quantum states, each with a certain probability. Mathematically, a mixed state is represented by a density matrix, which is a positive-semidefinite Hermitian operator with trace 1. If a system is in a mixed state, it means we have some classical uncertainty about which specific quantum state it's in. For example, a system might be in state |0‚ü© with probability 1/2 and in state |1‚ü© with probability 1/2. This would correspond to the mixed state represented by the density matrix œÅ = 1/2|0‚ü©‚ü®0| + 1/2|1‚ü©‚ü®1|.\n",

        "2. **Product State**: A product state refers to a state of a composite system that can be written as the tensor product of states of its subsystems. For example, if you have a two-qubit system and the first qubit is in state |0‚ü© and the second qubit is in state |1‚ü©, the overall state of the system is the product state |0‚ü©‚äó|1‚ü©, often written as |01‚ü©. A product state implies that there are no correlations between the subsystems, i.e., the subsystems are not entangled. If a state of a composite system cannot be written as a tensor product of states of its subsystems, it's called an entangled state.\n",

        "So, in summary, the difference lies in what each state represents: a mixed state represents classical uncertainty about which pure state a system is in, while a product state represents a separable (i.e., non-entangled) state of a composite system. Notably, these are not mutually exclusive: you can have a mixed state of product states, for example."

        "In quantum mechanics, the state of a quantum system is described by a mathematical object known as a quantum state. Quantum state tomography aims to reconstruct or characterize the complete quantum state of a system by performing measurements on the system in different bases or using various observables.\n",
        "\n",
        "Shadow tomography of quantum states is a specific technique used for quantum state reconstruction. It involves measuring the shadows or projections of the quantum state onto a set of measurement operators or observables. These measurements provide partial information about the quantum state, similar to the way shadows reveal information about the object casting them.\n",
        "\n",
        "The procedure for shadow tomography of quantum states typically involves preparing the system in different known initial states, applying a set of measurements or observables to the system, and then collecting the measurement outcomes. By repeating this process for a sufficiently large number of initial states and measurements, it becomes possible to reconstruct the complete quantum state of the system through computational methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "The reconstructed quantum state provides valuable information about the system's properties, such as its purity, entanglement, coherence, and other relevant characteristics. This information is crucial for understanding and characterizing quantum systems, as well as for verifying the performance of quantum devices and protocols.\n",
        "\n",
        "Quantum state tomography, including shadow tomography, plays a vital role in the development, verification, and optimization of quantum algorithms, quantum error correction, quantum communication, and other applications of quantum information science.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's important to note that quantum state tomography can be a challenging task due to various factors, such as noise, imperfections in measurements, and the exponential growth of the state space with the number of quantum bits (qubits). Researchers continually work on improving the efficiency and accuracy of quantum state tomography techniques to overcome these challenges."

In essence, it's a method used to figure out the unknown quantum state of a system.

        "For a quantum system, the state is typically represented by a density matrix. In the simplest case, for a single qubit, the density matrix is a 2x2 Hermitian matrix that is positive semi-definite and has trace 1. The generalization to multiple qubits is a matrix that is 2^n x 2^n (where n is the number of qubits), but with the same properties.\n",

        "**Trotterization** is a technique used in quantum computing to simulate the evolution of a quantum system under a Hamiltonian that is a sum of many terms. The idea is to break down the evolution into a sequence of smaller evolutions, each of which is under a single term of the Hamiltonian. This can be done because the exponential of a sum of matrices is approximately equal to the product of the exponentials of the individual matrices, up to a small error.\n",

While the classical Lanczos method has exponential cost in the system size to represent the Krylov states for quantum systems, our efficient quantum algorithm achieves this in polynomial time and memory. The construction presented is exact in the sense that the resulting Krylov space is identical to that of the Lanczos method, so the only approximation with respect to the exact method is due to finite sample noise. This is possible because, unlike previous quantum Krylov methods, our algorithm does not require simulating real or imaginary time evolution. We provide an explicit error bound for the resulting ground state energy estimate in the presence of noise.\n",

        "[**Magic state distillation**](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_state_distillation) is a procedure in quantum computation that is used to create high-fidelity quantum states, starting from several copies of a \"noisy\" state. The name \"distillation\" is used because it's similar to the idea of distilling a liquid to increase its purity.\n",

        "The technique was first proposed by Emanuel Knill in 2004, and further analyzed by Sergey Bravyi and Alexei Kitaev the same year.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a high-level overview of how it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Preparation**: Prepare several copies of a quantum state. These states are typically \"noisy\" copies of a desired magic state, meaning they have some errors or deviations from the perfect magic state.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Error Detection**: Apply a quantum error-detecting code to these copies. This code is a series of quantum operations that can identify (but not correct) certain errors in the quantum states.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Measurement**: Measure the error-detecting code. This does not directly measure the quantum states themselves but measures whether an error has been detected.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Post-selection**: If the measurement indicates that no errors were detected, then (due to the properties of quantum mechanics) the quantum states are projected into a state that is closer to the perfect magic state than the original states were. If an error was detected, discard the states and start over.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Repeat**: Repeat this process several times. Each time, the states get closer to the perfect magic state.\n",
        "\n",
        "By repeating this process, one can \"distill\" a set of noisy magic states into a smaller number of higher-fidelity magic states. This is a crucial part of many fault-tolerant quantum computing schemes, as it allows one to perform universal quantum computation even in the presence of noise."

        "\n",
        "Quantum error correction is a set of techniques for protecting quantum information from errors due to decoherence and other quantum noise. Here's a high-level summary:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Encoding**: The first step in quantum error correction is to encode the quantum information. Rather than storing a quantum bit of information (a \"qubit\") in a single physical qubit, we store it in multiple physical qubits. This is done in such a way that, even if some of the physical qubits are corrupted by noise, the original quantum information can still be recovered. This encoding is done using a quantum error-correcting code. There are many different types of quantum error-correcting codes, each with its strengths and weaknesses.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Syndrome measurement**: Once the quantum information has been encoded, the next step is to periodically check for errors. This is done by performing a syndrome measurement, which is a special kind of quantum measurement that can detect whether an error has occurred, and if so, what kind of error it was. Importantly, this measurement does not disturb the encoded quantum information.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Error correction**: If the syndrome measurement indicates that an error has occurred, the next step is to perform an error correction. This involves applying a series of quantum gates to the physical qubits to correct the error, based on the result of the syndrome measurement.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Repeat**: Because quantum systems are always subject to noise, this process of syndrome measurement and error correction needs to be repeated periodically to keep the errors in check.\n",
        "\n",
        "Challenges:\n",
        "\n",
        "* It's worth noting that the whole process of quantum error correction requires a significant overhead in terms of additional physical qubits and quantum operations. This is a major challenge in the development of large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers.\n",
        "\n",
        "* It's also worth noting that, although quantum error correction can protect against many types of errors, it cannot protect against all possible errors. In particular, **it's assumed that the errors are relatively rare and do not all occur at once, and that they are independent and identically distributed across the physical qubits**. **If these assumptions are violated, then quantum error correction may not be able to correct the errors**. This is another major challenge in the field of quantum error correction."

        "In quantum computing, Abelian groups are used to describe the symmetry of a quantum system. Symmetry is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, and it refers to the idea that a physical system will remain unchanged under certain transformations. For example, the symmetry of a quantum system may be described by a group of rotations, translations, or reflections. Abelian groups are used to describe the symmetry of a quantum system because they have the useful property of being commutative, meaning that the order in which the transformations are applied does not affect the outcome. This property makes it possible to use Abelian groups to describe the symmetries of a quantum system in a way that is mathematically tractable and easy to work with."

In fact, with collaborators we have proven that the color code is equivalent to a surface code (paper) up to a geometrically local unitary (one which only makes nearby qubits interact). One can think by analogy of the surface code* as a napkin with two rough and two smooth sides and the color code as folding this napkin along its diagonal. Because in the folded napkin, there are new things that are now close, it is possible to do more logical gates \"transversally\". This is good because it keeps errors from propagating and is relatively easy. However, the color code needs more qubits to interact in each stabilizer so ends up leading to a lower noise threshold. So one can say that although very similar, each code has its advantages and disadvantages.\n",

        " I am also frustrated by us and the media representing these anyon simulations as a \"step towards fault-tolerance\". Certainly topological codes are inspired by the physics of anyons and there are direct analogies between how those codes work and are realized and these simulations. I also have no doubt that certain aspects of these simulations have some degree of error robustness. But my understanding is that once you get serious about turning such simulations into a form of fault-tolerance appropriate for our devices and then try to optimize its realization you end up with the surface code. So while thinking about the physics of error-correction from this perspective might be useful and there are myriad mathematical similarities between what is going on in these simulations and topological codes, I think it is misleading/wrong to claim that performing these simulations is taking us any closer to fault-tolerance (whether the surface code or a different form of it). People keep telling me that I am misunderstanding this (and maybe I am!) but I have not been convinced of that yet.\n",
        "\n",
        "my objection, which might be different from Cody's, is that the title of this blog post suggests that this experiment is getting us closer to realizing universal fault-tolerant quantum computers. In particular, when we say it is a step closer to improved quantum computers, it makes it sound like this approach is somehow a step on our roadmap for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computers, or that it is going to make our ultimate goal easier or something like that. That is reading between the lines a little bit, but it is how it sounds to me. Is that actually true? Or is this in the category of \"nice demonstration, but not something we're going to follow up on, and thus not a step towards us improving quantum computers other than in the very broad sense that it helps test hardware capabilities like most physics team experiments do\"? My understanding is that nothing about this experiment is likely to change anything about how we are planning to realize fault-tolerance. Maybe that is incorrect, or it is correct and I am just reading too much into the implications of statements like the title. It would be nice to understand this better.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main sense in which the non-abelian anyons are useful for fault tolerance is that they are isomorphic to twists in the surface code, and you can use twists to store logical qubits. But we already knew about twists independent of this work e.g. from https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04673 so I don't know what it adds on the fault tolerance side.\n",
        "\n",
        "I did give a presentation to the authors of our abelian paper on how to do it fault tolerantly (they were technically \"using\" a surface code, but they were preparing it entirely unitarily which is not fault tolerant; you have to use measurements for everything). They weren't so interested I think, because the measurement version is harder and maybe also because they didn't consider it \"really doing it\" in the same way. I actually did run some quick shots of my versions of the circuits on the device back when pink was in M2 shape, and it worked, in that I got non-zero signal (the error rate was close to max but not max). I wasn't doing adept or etc or etc; if an experimentalist did it it would have been better. Also I now have much better versions of the circuit, which are described in https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07395 .\n",
        "\n",
        "My point was that if you interpret TQC as broadly (\"you have things that act like anyons\") then this is demonstrating something interesting (multiparticle entangled EC state, FT gates on that state).  But I also agree with Ryan in that I think the blog post does not convey this well.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fair enough, I'm just trying to put forth a perspective on why it is fine to say this is an interesting experiment in topological quantum computation.  And if you want some idea of how it might lead to noise protection, yes  https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9912040 which was expanded upon in https://arxiv.org/abs/0907.3988\n",

But I don't think any of that really justifies the framing of the blog post title, which to me suggests that this is moving us closer to building a fault-tolerant quantum computer as opposed to exploring the error robustness of anyon simulation."

Second, the ability to solve HSP for non-Abelian groups in polynomial time would enable us to extend the set of problems on which quantum computers offer substantial performance advantage. In this introductory talk, I will recap essential concepts from group theory before defining the Hidden Subgroup Problem and describing the quantum algorithm that solves it quickly.

This limited information makes it difficult to directly extract the subgroup.\n",

        "\n",
        "To understand this, let's first break down some key concepts in quantum computing:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Block Encoding**: In quantum computing, block encoding is a method of representing a matrix in a larger, unitary matrix so that the original matrix becomes a sub-block of this larger matrix. This technique is used to allow us to perform certain operations more easily.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Qubitization**: Qubitization is a quantum algorithm technique, which uses the block-encoding of a matrix to perform a quantum walk on it. The method uses significantly fewer resources than other quantum algorithms for similar problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Time Evolution**: Time evolution in quantum computing typically refers to how a quantum state changes over time according to the Schr√∂dinger equation. It is often used to simulate physical systems in quantum simulations.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Phase Estimation**: Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) is a fundamental algorithm in quantum computing which estimates the phase (or eigenvalue) of an eigenvector of a unitary operator. It's a key component in many quantum algorithms, such as Shor's algorithm and quantum simulation algorithms.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Filtering the Zero Eigenvalue**: This refers to the process of isolating or eliminating states with zero eigenvalues. It can be a way of refining results or simplifying calculations in quantum algorithms.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, to the context you provided: \"Block encoding & qubitization instead of time evolution. Use filtering of the zero eigenvalue rather than phase estimation.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "This essentially suggests a strategy for tackling a quantum computing task. Instead of using the time evolution operator (a more traditional approach to quantum simulations), this is advocating the use of block encoding and qubitization. These methods can provide a more resource-efficient approach for certain types of quantum computations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Similarly, \"using filtering of the zero eigenvalue rather than phase estimation\" suggests a preferential way of isolating the states you're interested in. While phase estimation is a powerful tool, it can be resource-intensive. Filtering the zero eigenvalue might be a more efficient approach in certain contexts, particularly when zero eigenvalues represent \"unwanted\" states that might complicate or slow the computation."

        "The Fourier transform approximates a given periodic signal with simpler periodic signals with a given set of frequencies. It is used in image, video, and radio transmissions, to name just a few areas we interact with everyday. As the image shows,  if we apply the (inverse) Fourier transform to a signal that has a frequency of 4.7 we get increasingly better approximations for its frequency. With three qubits, we have 8 frequencies available (0 through 7). The first step indicates that the frequency is in the second half of the range (those frequencies have a higher probability). The second step assigns a higher probability to the first half of the second half (4 and 5). The third and last step gives more probability to 5, with the ratios of the probabilities of 4 and 5 being correlated with the decimal part of 4.7.\n",

If you look at its implementation, it pretty much makes every step look like a quantum gate (a combination of Hadamard and Phase gates). Its structure is the essence of how quantum computing works. Even better, the quantum implementation takes advantage of quantum parallelism, enabled by decomposing operations by digit/qubit, to make the transformation exponentially faster.\n",

        "It is worth understanding the details of how the advantage works. Decomposing by digits is an essential ingredient, that coupled with interference allows quantum parallelism to provide an exponential speed-up.

Spin resonance spectroscopy is an important technique in fields as diverse as materials science, physics, chemistry and biology. In this study we demonstrate a device capable of beating the spin detection sensitivity of conventional spectrometers by many orders of magnitude. The performance matches previous demonstrations using superconducting quantum technologies, but importantly integrates the core components into a single device and works at higher magnetic fields and temperatures, which is critical for the practical use of this technology.

This ensures that the system will end up in the ground state of the final Hamiltonian, which is the solution to the problem.\n",

Many published papers and articles suggest that the accuracy of QSVC is either similar or superior to other well-known algorithms like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression. However, these comparisons often suffer from several limitations:\n",

        "3. Lack of Hyperparameter Tuning: QSVC is often tested against models with default parameters, ignoring the potential improvements from hyperparameter tuning.\n",
        "4. Comparison with Basic Models: The evaluation is usually against well-known but basic models, rather than state-of-the-art classification models like gradient boosting.\n",
        "\n",
        "Given these limitations, a key question arises: Can QSVC outperform a well-tuned XGBoost model? The answer is \"yes, it is possible\", but with several caveats:\n",

        "1. Data Preprocessing: QSVC requires careful data preprocessing and dimensionality reduction.\n",

        "3. Parameter Tuning: Parameters like \"C\" can have a significant impact on the model's performance.\n",
        "4. Scaling Observations: As the number of observations increases, the entire process needs to be reparameterized to avoid stagnation or decline in AUC.\n",
        "5. Kernel Training: Quantum kernel training procedures could be required to secure better SVC performance later.\n",

In QSQ, the learner has access to a quantum oracle that can answer queries about the distribution of a quantum state, and the goal is to learn a hypothesis that predicts the output of the oracle with high accuracy.\n",

        "  * The main difference between a quantum example oracle and a PAC learner is that a quantum example oracle provides the learner with quantum states, while a PAC learner provides the learner with labeled examples. Quantum states are more powerful than labeled examples (from PAC), because they can represent a superposition of multiple inputs and outputs. This means that a quantum example oracle can provide the learner with more information about the function being learned. ***As a result, quantum example oracles can be used to learn functions that are more difficult to learn with classical PAC learners.*** For example, it has been shown that DNF formulas can be learned efficiently with a quantum example oracle, but they are not known to be efficiently learnable with a classical PAC learner.\n",
        "  * Another example of a quantum oracle is the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm. This algorithm takes a function f:{0,1}^n->{0,1} as input, and determines whether f is constant or balanced. A constant function is one that always outputs the same value, regardless of its input. A balanced function is one that outputs 1 half of the time and 0 half of the time. The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm works by first creating a superposition of all possible inputs to f. It then applies the oracle to this superposition. If f is constant, then the oracle will not change the superposition. However, if f is balanced, then the oracle will flip the phase of half of the states in the superposition. Finally, the algorithm measures the superposition. If the measurement result is 0, then f is constant. If the measurement result is 1, then f is balanced.\n"

These algorithms employ a hybrid quantum-classical approach, which allows classical optimization techniques to be used in the learning process. This means classical techniques for managing gradient scaling, like batch normalization or gradient clipping, can still be applicable in this quantum setting.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Parameter Shift Rule:** The parameter-shift rule is a method for computing gradients in quantum circuits, which is particularly important for variational quantum algorithms. The rule ensures that for certain types of quantum gates (those that generate rotations), the gradient of the expectation value of a quantum circuit with respect to a parameter can be computed exactly, regardless of the number of qubits or the complexity of the circuit. This rule allows the derivative of a quantum circuit output with respect to its parameters to be computed in terms of circuit evaluations. Given a parameterized quantum gate (say, a rotation gate), the derivative of the expectation value of an observable with respect to the parameter can be computed as the difference between the expectation values of the observable for two slightly different values of the parameter. These \"shifted\" parameter values are typically chosen to be a small positive or negative shift from the original parameter value. The parameter-shift rule is powerful because it allows us to compute exact gradients using only additional evaluations of the quantum circuit, with no need for complex computations involving the inner workings of the quantum operations.\n",

        "3. **Adjoint method**: The adjoint method, also known as the reverse-mode differentiation, is a technique borrowed from classical automatic differentiation, generalized to the context of quantum circuits. It involves running the quantum circuit forward, storing the state at each step, and then running a modified version of the circuit backward to calculate the derivatives. This method is efficient in terms of the number of quantum operations required, especially for circuits with many parameters but a single output (as is common in quantum machine learning models). However, it requires the ability to run quantum operations in reverse, as well as the ability to store quantum states, which can be challenging to implement on near-term quantum devices.\n",

        "1. **Vanishing gradients:** When deep neural networks are trained, gradients of the loss function can become very small.

This problem is particularly common with activation functions like the sigmoid or hyperbolic tangent, which squish a large input space into a small output range.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Exploding gradients:** Conversely, gradients can also become very large, leading to large updates to the weights and causing the model to oscillate around the optimal solution, or even to diverge entirely. This is often a problem in recurrent neural networks (RNNs).\n",

        "Various techniques have been proposed to mitigate these issues:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Gradient clipping:** This is a common technique to prevent exploding gradients. If the norm of the gradient exceeds a certain threshold, we scale it back to prevent it from getting too large.\n",

        "3. **Choice of activation function:** The choice of activation function can help alleviate the vanishing gradients problem.

        "***How can you measure Circuit Expressivity?***\n",
        "\n",
        "In the context of quantum computing and quantum machine learning, \"circuit expressivity\" is a term often used to describe the ability of a quantum circuit to represent a wide range of quantum operations or states. To measure the expressivity of a quantum circuit, researchers typically consider a variety of factors, including the diversity of the unitary operations the circuit can generate and the complexity of the quantum states it can prepare. Here are a few methods that might be used to measure the expressivity of a quantum circuit:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Entangling Power**: The ability of a circuit to create entangled states is often used as a measure of its expressivity. More expressive circuits can create a wider variety of complex, entangled states. The entangling power can be quantified using various measures, such as the entanglement entropy or entanglement witness.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Expressive Power of Gates**: The variety and expressive power of the gates used in the circuit can be a significant factor. Universal gate sets can generate any unitary operation, and thus have high expressivity. The specific combination of gates and the connectivity of the quantum hardware can also influence the expressivity of a circuit.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Circuit Depth and Width**: The depth (number of sequential gate operations) and the width (number of qubits) of a circuit can influence its expressivity. Deeper and wider circuits can potentially represent more complex unitary operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Volume of the Unitary Group**: Analyze the volume of the unitary group that the circuit can generate. This can be measured using various metrics, such as the 2-design or the t-design, which quantify how closely the set of unitary operations generated by the circuit approximates the entire unitary group.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Variational Expressivity**: In variational quantum algorithms, the expressivity can be measured by the ability of the variational form to represent a wide range of quantum states. This can be quantified using metrics like the expressivity of the ansatz, which measures the diversity of the states that can be generated by varying the parameters of the variational form.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Schatten Norm**: The Schatten norm of the difference between the unitary matrices generated by the circuit and a target unitary operation can be used as a measure of the expressivity. Smaller values of the Schatten norm indicate higher expressivity.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Fidelity**: The fidelity between the states generated by the circuit and a set of target states can be used to measure expressivity. Higher fidelity indicates that the circuit can more closely approximate the target states, suggesting higher expressivity.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Spectral Gap**: The spectral gap of the Hamiltonian that describes the quantum circuit can also be a factor in its expressivity. Circuits associated with Hamiltonians with small spectral gaps might be able to represent more complex quantum operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Loschmidt Echo**: The Loschmidt echo, which measures the reversibility of the evolution generated by the circuit, can also be used as a measure of expressivity. Circuits with smaller Loschmidt echoes might be more expressive, as they can generate more irreversible, complex dynamics.\n",
        "  * The Loschmidt echo is a measure of the revival occurring when an imperfect time-reversal procedure is applied to a complex quantum system. http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Loschmidt_echo\n",
        "  * Used in \"Out-of-distribution generalization for learning quantum dynamics\" to compute cost function\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **Quantum Volume**: Quantum volume is a metric that takes into account both the number of qubits and the error rates of the operations in a quantum circuit. Higher quantum volume indicates a more expressive circuit.\n",

But Hawking said if you want to see a smooth geometry of spacetime at the event horizon, the qubits need to be entangled. (In QFT spacetime is built up of a huge amount of local entanglement. No entanglement = no smooth spacetime, which means space and time end at the event horizon = the firewall). But this end of spacetime is at the singularity, not at the event horizon already).\n",

        "*Exkurs: Combinational Logic vs Sequential logic (Automata theory): [Sequential logic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_logic): type of logic circuit whose output depends on present value of its input signals and on sequence of past inputs (history). Sequential logic has state (memory). Sequential logic is used to store the state of the automaton, which is necessary to track the current position of the tape head and the symbols that have been read (more complex, because requires a larger number of memory elements, and the logic to update the state of the automaton can be more complicated). The sequential logic is implemented using flip-flops, which are memory elements that can store a single bit of information. [Combinational Logic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinational_logic): output is a function of only the present input. Combinational logic does not have a state (memory). Combinatorial logic is used to determine the next state of the automaton and the output symbol to be written to the tape, based on the current state, the input symbol, and the contents of the tape. Combinational logic is used in computer circuits to perform Boolean algebra on input signals and on stored data. The ALU is constructed using combinational logic, also half adders, full adders, half subtractors, full subtractors, multiplexers, demultiplexers, encoders and decoders, AND, OR, and NOT. The combinational logic is typically much simpler than the sequential logic. This is because the next state of the automaton and the output symbol to be written to the tape can be determined by a relatively small number of input variables.*\n",

Scott aaronson: doing the soap experiment: you need to repeat the trial several times, it does not always find the best solution. it seems to find a local optimum mostly. Prions in protein: local optima! Scott Aaronson: [Black Holes, Firewalls, and the Limits of Quantum Computers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cstKRACrMQY&t=2446). And it cannot scale to large number of nails. **In the case of soap bubbles, nature just seems to apply a really fast approximation which is accurate for small cases but breaks down at larger instances** (due to actual physical properties... i.e. it is physically impossible to build arbitrarily thin rods to dip into soapy water.) Many other NP-problems can be modeled as physical systems in which a lowest-energy-state would correspond to a solution to the combinatorial problem. You can find that \"DNA computing\" solves the clique problem, for instance. [Source](https://groups.google.com/g/comp.theory/c/11lY926-P7M?pli=1)\n",

Shor's algorithm shows that it is possible to factor large integers in polynomial time using a quantum computer, while Gidney's work shows that it is also possible to solve the discrete logarithm problem in polynomial time using a quantum computer. These results have major implications for cryptography, as many of the most widely used cryptographic systems are based on the difficulty of factoring large integers or solving the discrete logarithm problem."

        "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) are both techniques used in linear algebra and data analysis, but they are used for somewhat different purposes and their computations are based on different principles. Here's a comparison:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. The number of principal components is less than or equal to the number of original variables. The transformation is done in such a way that the first principal component has the largest possible variance (i.e., accounts for as much of the variability in the data as possible), and each succeeding component, in turn, has the highest variance possible under the constraint that it is orthogonal to (i.e., uncorrelated with) the preceding components. PCA is often used in exploratory data analysis and for making predictive models.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)** is a method of decomposing a matrix into three other matrices. Given a matrix A, you can decompose it into three matrices U, Œ£, and V^T such that A = UŒ£V^T. The U and V matrices contain orthogonal vectors (the left and right singular vectors), and Œ£ contains the singular values, which can be thought of as the \"strength\" or \"importance\" of the corresponding singular vectors. The SVD is a fundamental operation in linear algebra, and it has a wide range of applications. It's used in solving systems of linear equations, inverting matrices, and is the backbone of many data reduction techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "The relationship between PCA and SVD is as follows: PCA can be solved by applying the SVD on the data matrix (more precisely, on the covariance or correlation matrix of the data). The principal components resulting from PCA are equivalent to the right singular vectors resulting from the SVD (after some scaling). In other words, PCA can be considered a special case of SVD.\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite their relationship, the methods are typically used in different contexts: **PCA is mainly used in the context of data analysis, for tasks like dimensionality reduction and extracting useful features from data, while SVD is a more general tool in linear algebra with a wider range of applications**."

        "\n",
        "The condition number is calculated as the ratio of the largest singular value of a matrix to the smallest singular value. In other words, it gives us a measure of how much the output value of the function can change for a small change in the input.\n",

        "If a matrix has a low condition number, it means the matrix is well-conditioned, implying that the system of equations has a unique solution, and this solution can be found accurately by numerical methods. The solution will not significantly change even if the input is perturbed slightly.\n",

        "On the other hand, if the condition number is high, the matrix is said to be ill-conditioned. This indicates that the system is sensitive to small changes in the input, and even a slight change in the input could produce a large change in the result. Thus, the solution may not be accurately computable due to rounding errors and other numerical errors.\n",

For example, a condition number of 10^12 would indicate that up to 12 digits of precision could be lost in the computation.\n",

Quantum walks extend this idea to the quantum realm, and their properties have been used to design new quantum algorithms. The structure of the graph can greatly impact the behavior of the quantum walk.\n",

        "\n",
        "But it‚Äôs possible to say more than that. From reading popular articles, many people have the vague impression that a quantum computer could just try every possible solution in parallel. And if that‚Äôs all you know about them, then it‚Äôs indeed a mystery why they couldn‚Äôt solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time!\n",
        "\n",
        "The central difficulty is that, for a computer to be useful, at some point you need to measure it to observe an answer. And if you just measured an equal superposition over all possible answers, not having done anything else, the rules of QM dictate that you‚Äôll just see a random answer. And of course, if you‚Äôd just wanted a random answer, you could‚Äôve picked one yourself with a lot less trouble!\n",
        "\n",
        "So the name of the game, with every quantum algorithm, is somehow orchestrating a pattern of constructive and destructive quantum interference that boosts the probability of the correct answer (even though you yourself don‚Äôt know in advance which answer is the correct one!), and that does so efficiently. Famously, in 1994 Peter Shor showed how to do that for the problem of factoring integers, and a few related problems in number theory‚Äîbut he was able to do so only by exploiting extremely special structure in those problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "For more ‚Äúgeneric‚Äù search problems, like NP-complete problems, the best we generally know is Grover‚Äôs algorithm: a quantum algorithm that‚Äôs able to find the right answer (i.e., concentrate a large fraction of the amplitude on that answer) in roughly the square root of the number of steps that would be needed classically. So you get some speedup, but not an exponential one.\n",
        "\n",
        "But we also know that, if your search problem is a ‚Äúblack box‚Äù‚Äîi.e., you can just pick candidate solutions and evaluate if they‚Äôre correct, and you don‚Äôt know anything more about the problem‚Äôs structure‚Äîthen Grover‚Äôs algorithm is the best that even a quantum computer can do. This is the content of the so-called BBBV (Bennett, Bernstein, Brassard, Vazirani) Theorem, which has several proofs, all of them crucially relying on the linearity of unitary evolution. The BBBV Theorem gives a fundamental explanation for why any fast quantum algorithm for NP-complete problems would have to look very different from anything that we know today‚Äîmuch like a fast classical algorithm would have to*."

Since a finite graph is a 1-complex (i.e., its 'faces' are the vertices - which are 0-dimensional, and the edges - which are 1-dimensional), the only non-trivial homology groups are the 0-th group and the 1-th group.\n",
