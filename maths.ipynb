First, we approximately reconstruct the entire expectation landscape spanned by the parameters of the quantum circuit, i.e., the local field and coupling coefficients of the system Hamiltonian. This can be seen as building a surrogate function for the true quantum expectation landscape. After this initial overhead, we can evaluate our surrogate for new circuit parameters in fractions of a second to a few seconds on a Laptop for the most complicated 127-qubit cases. Changing the Hamiltonian coefficients or the simulation time can all be done in post-processing and is very fast.\n",

Mathematically, a mixed state is represented by a density matrix, which is a positive-semidefinite Hermitian operator with trace 1. If a system is in a mixed state, it means we have some classical uncertainty about which specific quantum state it's in. For example, a system might be in state |0⟩ with probability 1/2 and in state |1⟩ with probability 1/2. This would correspond to the mixed state represented by the density matrix ρ = 1/2|0⟩⟨0| + 1/2|1⟩⟨1|.\n",

A product state implies that there are no correlations between the subsystems, i.e., the subsystems are not entangled.

It draws inspiration from classical annealing, a process in which a system is gradually cooled to find its lowest energy state. The hope in quantum annealing is to leverage quantum properties, such as superposition and tunneling, to more efficiently explore the solution space and find the ground state, which represents the minimum of the objective function.\n",

        "1. **Local Minima and Global Minima**: In complex optimization problems, there are often many local minima. Finding the global minimum (or a sufficiently good approximation of it) is the main challenge. High connectivity means that the system can more easily explore the solution space, jumping from one potential solution to another and avoiding getting trapped in local minima.\n",

If the quantum system's connectivity is low, the benefit from quantum tunneling can be diminished.\n",

With fewer connections, the qubits are limited in their interactions, making the exploration less effective.</font>\n",

        "Dicke states are important for quantum computing for a number of reasons. First, they are a type of entangled state, which means that the qubits in a Dicke state are correlated with each other in a way that cannot be explained by classical physics. This entanglement can be exploited to perform quantum algorithms that are much faster than any possible classical algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "Second, Dicke states are relatively easy to prepare on a quantum computer. This is because there are a number of efficient quantum circuits that can be used to create Dicke states. This makes them a good candidate for use in practical quantum computing applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "Third, Dicke states have a number of other applications in quantum information science. For example, they can be used to create quantum memories, quantum communication channels, and quantum simulators.\n",

        "Here are some specific examples of the applications of Dicke states in quantum computing:\n",

        "* **Quantum algorithms:** Dicke states can be used to speed up a variety of quantum algorithms, such as the Shor's algorithm for factoring large numbers and the Grover's algorithm for searching an unsorted database.\n",

        "* **Quantum simulation:** Dicke states can be used to simulate the behavior of physical systems, such as molecules and materials.\n",

        "\n",
        "Quantum error correction is a set of techniques for protecting quantum information from errors due to decoherence and other quantum noise. Here's a high-level summary:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Encoding**: The first step in quantum error correction is to encode the quantum information. Rather than storing a quantum bit of information (a \"qubit\") in a single physical qubit, we store it in multiple physical qubits. This is done in such a way that, even if some of the physical qubits are corrupted by noise, the original quantum information can still be recovered. This encoding is done using a quantum error-correcting code. There are many different types of quantum error-correcting codes, each with its strengths and weaknesses.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Syndrome measurement**: Once the quantum information has been encoded, the next step is to periodically check for errors. This is done by performing a syndrome measurement, which is a special kind of quantum measurement that can detect whether an error has occurred, and if so, what kind of error it was. Importantly, this measurement does not disturb the encoded quantum information.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Error correction**: If the syndrome measurement indicates that an error has occurred, the next step is to perform an error correction. This involves applying a series of quantum gates to the physical qubits to correct the error, based on the result of the syndrome measurement.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Repeat**: Because quantum systems are always subject to noise, this process of syndrome measurement and error correction needs to be repeated periodically to keep the errors in check.\n",
        "\n",
        "Challenges:\n",
        "\n",
        "* It's worth noting that the whole process of quantum error correction requires a significant overhead in terms of additional physical qubits and quantum operations. This is a major challenge in the development of large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers.\n",
        "\n",
        "* It's also worth noting that, although quantum error correction can protect against many types of errors, it cannot protect against all possible errors. In particular, **it's assumed that the errors are relatively rare and do not all occur at once, and that they are independent and identically distributed across the physical qubits**. **If these assumptions are violated, then quantum error correction may not be able to correct the errors**. This is another major challenge in the field of quantum error correction."

Symmetry is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, and it refers to the idea that a physical system will remain unchanged under certain transformations. For example, the symmetry of a quantum system may be described by a group of rotations, translations, or reflections. Abelian groups are used to describe the symmetry of a quantum system because they have the useful property of being commutative, meaning that the order in which the transformations are applied does not affect the outcome. This property makes it possible to use Abelian groups to describe the symmetries of a quantum system in a way that is mathematically tractable and easy to work with."

The basic idea behind stabilizer codes is to encode the quantum information using a set of stabilizer operators, such that any errors that occur in the system can be detected and corrected by measuring the values of these operators.

In fact, with collaborators we have proven that the color code is equivalent to a surface code (paper) up to a geometrically local unitary (one which only makes nearby qubits interact). One can think by analogy of the surface code* as a napkin with two rough and two smooth sides and the color code as folding this napkin along its diagonal. Because in the folded napkin, there are new things that are now close, it is possible to do more logical gates \"transversally\". This is good because it keeps errors from propagating and is relatively easy. However, the color code needs more qubits to interact in each stabilizer so ends up leading to a lower noise threshold. So one can say that although very similar, each code has its advantages and disadvantages.\n",

        " I am also frustrated by us and the media representing these anyon simulations as a \"step towards fault-tolerance\". Certainly topological codes are inspired by the physics of anyons and there are direct analogies between how those codes work and are realized and these simulations. I also have no doubt that certain aspects of these simulations have some degree of error robustness. But my understanding is that once you get serious about turning such simulations into a form of fault-tolerance appropriate for our devices and then try to optimize its realization you end up with the surface code. So while thinking about the physics of error-correction from this perspective might be useful and there are myriad mathematical similarities between what is going on in these simulations and topological codes, I think it is misleading/wrong to claim that performing these simulations is taking us any closer to fault-tolerance (whether the surface code or a different form of it). People keep telling me that I am misunderstanding this (and maybe I am!) but I have not been convinced of that yet.\n",

        "my objection, which might be different from Cody's, is that the title of this blog post suggests that this experiment is getting us closer to realizing universal fault-tolerant quantum computers. In particular, when we say it is a step closer to improved quantum computers, it makes it sound like this approach is somehow a step on our roadmap for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computers, or that it is going to make our ultimate goal easier or something like that. That is reading between the lines a little bit, but it is how it sounds to me. Is that actually true? Or is this in the category of \"nice demonstration, but not something we're going to follow up on, and thus not a step towards us improving quantum computers other than in the very broad sense that it helps test hardware capabilities like most physics team experiments do\"? My understanding is that nothing about this experiment is likely to change anything about how we are planning to realize fault-tolerance. Maybe that is incorrect, or it is correct and I am just reading too much into the implications of statements like the title. It would be nice to understand this better.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main sense in which the non-abelian anyons are useful for fault tolerance is that they are isomorphic to twists in the surface code, and you can use twists to store logical qubits. But we already knew about twists independent of this work e.g. from https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04673 so I don't know what it adds on the fault tolerance side.\n",
        "\n",
        "I did give a presentation to the authors of our abelian paper on how to do it fault tolerantly (they were technically \"using\" a surface code, but they were preparing it entirely unitarily which is not fault tolerant; you have to use measurements for everything). They weren't so interested I think, because the measurement version is harder and maybe also because they didn't consider it \"really doing it\" in the same way. I actually did run some quick shots of my versions of the circuits on the device back when pink was in M2 shape, and it worked, in that I got non-zero signal (the error rate was close to max but not max). I wasn't doing adept or etc or etc; if an experimentalist did it it would have been better. Also I now have much better versions of the circuit, which are described in https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07395 .\n",

        "Shadow tomography, also known as X-ray phase-contrast imaging or phase tomography, is a technique used to create detailed three-dimensional images of an object's internal structure. It is primarily employed in the field of medical imaging but also finds applications in materials science and other areas.\n",
        "\n",
        "Traditional X-ray imaging relies on the attenuation of X-rays as they pass through different tissues or materials, resulting in a two-dimensional projection image that shows variations in X-ray absorption. However, some tissues or materials have similar absorption properties, making it challenging to distinguish between them based solely on their attenuation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Shadow tomography overcomes this limitation by exploiting the phase shift of X-rays as they pass through an object. When X-rays encounter a boundary between two materials with different refractive indices, they undergo a phase shift. This phase shift contains valuable information about the object's internal structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "To perform shadow tomography, a coherent X-ray source, such as a synchrotron or an X-ray tube, is used. The X-rays pass through the object and are collected by a detector placed behind it. The collected X-rays contain both intensity and phase information.\n",
        "\n",
        "The key to shadow tomography lies in extracting the phase information from the intensity measurements. This is typically achieved by using specialized techniques such as interferometry or grating-based methods. These methods create interference patterns that encode the phase information, which can then be computationally reconstructed into a three-dimensional image.\n",
        "\n",
        "The resulting shadow tomography image provides not only information about the X-ray absorption but also about the object's refractive index distribution and other structural features. This enables visualization of fine details, such as boundaries between tissues or subtle density variations, which may not be easily distinguishable in traditional X-ray images.\n",
        "\n",
        "Shadow tomography has the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and enhance our understanding of complex biological and materials systems. However, it currently requires advanced X-ray sources and specialized techniques, limiting its widespread availability in clinical settings. Nevertheless, ongoing research and technological advancements aim to make shadow tomography more accessible and applicable in various fields."

In the simplest case, for a single qubit, the density matrix is a 2x2 Hermitian matrix that is positive semi-definite and has trace 1. The generalization to multiple qubits is a matrix that is 2^n x 2^n (where n is the number of qubits), but with the same properties.\n",

While the classical Lanczos method has exponential cost in the system size to represent the Krylov states for quantum systems, our efficient quantum algorithm achieves this in polynomial time and memory. The construction presented is exact in the sense that the resulting Krylov space is identical to that of the Lanczos method, so the only approximation with respect to the exact method is due to finite sample noise. This is possible because, unlike previous quantum Krylov methods, our algorithm does not require simulating real or imaginary time evolution. We provide an explicit error bound for the resulting ground state energy estimate in the presence of noise.\n",

        "The Anatomy of Quantum Advantage\n",
        "\n",
        "The best known quantum advantage comes from the quantum Fourier transform, used in both Shor's and Grover's algorithms. Here is why.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Fourier transform approximates a given periodic signal with simpler periodic signals with a given set of frequencies. It is used in image, video, and radio transmissions, to name just a few areas we interact with everyday. As the image shows,  if we apply the (inverse) Fourier transform to a signal that has a frequency of 4.7 we get increasingly better approximations for its frequency. With three qubits, we have 8 frequencies available (0 through 7). The first step indicates that the frequency is in the second half of the range (those frequencies have a higher probability). The second step assigns a higher probability to the first half of the second half (4 and 5). The third and last step gives more probability to 5, with the ratios of the probabilities of 4 and 5 being correlated with the decimal part of 4.7.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is an amazing procedure, a probabilistic version of a binary search (for an integer frequency it acts like a binary search, as I pointed out in a previous post).\n",
        "\n",
        "The fast Fourier transform (FFT) is a version of the algorithm that is extremely efficient. If you look at its implementation, it pretty much makes every step look like a quantum gate (a combination of Hadamard and Phase gates). Its structure is the essence of how quantum computing works. Even better, the quantum implementation takes advantage of quantum parallelism, enabled by decomposing operations by digit/qubit, to make the transformation exponentially faster.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is worth understanding the details of how the advantage works. Decomposing by digits is an essential ingredient, that coupled with interference allows quantum parallelism to provide an exponential speed-up. The combinatorial structure is the key, and the place where other advantage sources may be found in the future. I also think the discrete sinc distribution can play a bigger role in quantum computing.\n",

Spin resonance spectroscopy is an important technique in fields as diverse as materials science, physics, chemistry and biology. In this study we demonstrate a device capable of beating the spin detection sensitivity of conventional spectrometers by many orders of magnitude. The performance matches previous demonstrations using superconducting quantum technologies, but importantly integrates the core components into a single device and works at higher magnetic fields and temperatures, which is critical for the practical use of this technology.

        "3. **Time Evolution**: Time evolution in quantum computing typically refers to how a quantum state changes over time according to the Schrödinger equation. It is often used to simulate physical systems in quantum simulations.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Phase Estimation**: Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) is a fundamental algorithm in quantum computing which estimates the phase (or eigenvalue) of an eigenvector of a unitary operator. It's a key component in many quantum algorithms, such as Shor's algorithm and quantum simulation algorithms.\n",

First, the study of the problem sheds some light on what it is that quantum computers are really good at. Second, the ability to solve HSP for non-Abelian groups in polynomial time would enable us to extend the set of problems on which quantum computers offer substantial performance advantage. In this introductory talk, I will recap essential concepts from group theory before defining the Hidden Subgroup Problem and describing the quantum algorithm that solves it quickly.

This limited information makes it difficult to directly extract the subgroup.\n",

        "Chaitin complexity was first introduced by Gregory Chaitin in the 1960s. Chaitin showed that the halting problem, which is the problem of determining whether a given computer program will halt, is equivalent to the problem of determining the Chaitin complexity of a program. This means that it is impossible to determine the Chaitin complexity of a program without actually running the program.\n",

        "Chaitin complexity has been used to study a variety of problems in theoretical computer science, including the compressibility of data, the randomness of sequences, and the halting problem. It has also been applied to problems in physics, biology, and philosophy.\n",

A major challenge in QNN development is a concentration of measure phenomenon known as a barren plateau that leads to exponentially small gradients for a range of QNNs models. In this work, we examine the assumptions that give rise to barren plateaus and show that an unbounded loss function can circumvent the existing no-go results. We propose a training algorithm that minimizes the maximal Renyi divergence of order two and present techniques for gradient computation. We compute the closed form of the gradients for Unitary QNNs and Quantum Boltzmann Machines and provide sufficient conditions for the absence of barren plateaus in these models. We demonstrate our approach in two use cases: thermal state learning and Hamiltonian learning. In our numerical experiments, we observed rapid convergence of our training loss function and frequently archived a 99% average fidelity in fewer than 100 epochs.\n"

        "3. **Choice of activation function:** The choice of activation function can help alleviate the vanishing gradients problem. For example, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) and its variants (like Leaky ReLU and Parametric ReLU) are commonly used because they do not saturate for positive inputs.\n",
        "\n",

        "As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, ensuring proper backpropagation scaling in quantum machine learning is an active area of research. A few of the techniques that have been suggested for improving gradient scaling and thus learning in quantum machine learning systems include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Variational Quantum Algorithms:** In the field of quantum machine learning, Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) like the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) or Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) are commonly used. These algorithms employ a hybrid quantum-classical approach, which allows classical optimization techniques to be used in the learning process. This means classical techniques for managing gradient scaling, like batch normalization or gradient clipping, can still be applicable in this quantum setting.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Parameter Shift Rule:** The parameter-shift rule is a method for computing gradients in quantum circuits, which is particularly important for variational quantum algorithms. The rule ensures that for certain types of quantum gates (those that generate rotations), the gradient of the expectation value of a quantum circuit with respect to a parameter can be computed exactly, regardless of the number of qubits or the complexity of the circuit.\n",

This approach can help to alleviate barren plateaus -- regions in the cost function landscape where the variance of the gradients vanishes exponentially with increasing system size.\n",

This is done by propagating errors backwards through the network, layer by layer, hence the name \"backpropagation\".\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Here are some reasons why backpropagation may not easily scale in quantum machine learning:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Non-commutativity of operators**: Quantum operations, unlike classical ones, are represented by operators that generally do not commute, meaning the order in which they are applied matters. This non-commutativity makes the computation of gradients more complex than in the classical case.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Measurement**: In quantum mechanics, obtaining information about the state of a system involves measurement, which is a probabilistic process that collapses the state of the system. The inherent randomness of measurement makes the direct application of backpropagation problematic.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Complexity of quantum states**: Quantum states live in a complex vector space and can exist in a superposition of multiple states simultaneously, further complicating the process of backpropagation.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Barren plateaus**: In the context of variational quantum algorithms, it's been found that the cost function landscape often suffers from the problem of \"barren plateaus\", where the function is flat almost everywhere. This makes it difficult for gradient-based methods like backpropagation to find a direction to move in to improve the function.\n",
        "\n",
        "To address these challenges, researchers have developed quantum versions of backpropagation, such as the parameter-shift rule and the adjoint method, which are used to compute gradients of quantum circuits. However, these methods often require additional quantum resources, making it difficult to scale them up to larger quantum systems. New methods and strategies to overcome these issues are an active area of research in quantum machine learning."

        "\n",
        "1. **Parameter-shift rule**: This rule allows the derivative of a quantum circuit output with respect to its parameters to be computed in terms of circuit evaluations. Given a parameterized quantum gate (say, a rotation gate), the derivative of the expectation value of an observable with respect to the parameter can be computed as the difference between the expectation values of the observable for two slightly different values of the parameter. These \"shifted\" parameter values are typically chosen to be a small positive or negative shift from the original parameter value.\n",

        "    The parameter-shift rule is powerful because it allows us to compute exact gradients using only additional evaluations of the quantum circuit, with no need for complex computations involving the inner workings of the quantum operations. This makes it well-suited to hardware implementations, as the additional circuit evaluations can be run on the quantum device.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Adjoint method**: The adjoint method, also known as the reverse-mode differentiation, is a technique borrowed from classical automatic differentiation, generalized to the context of quantum circuits. It involves running the quantum circuit forward, storing the state at each step, and then running a modified version of the circuit backward to calculate the derivatives.\n",
        "\n",
        "   This method is efficient in terms of the number of quantum operations required, especially for circuits with many parameters but a single output (as is common in quantum machine learning models). However, it requires the ability to run quantum operations in reverse, as well as the ability to store quantum states, which can be challenging to implement on near-term quantum devices.\n",

        "\n",
        "Similarly, in a quantum circuit used for machine learning (a variational quantum circuit), the expressibility refers to the range of quantum states that the circuit can generate or the set of unitary transformations it can perform. The expressibility of a quantum learning circuit can affect its ability to learn complex patterns in quantum data.\n",
        "\n",
        "In both cases, having high expressibility can be beneficial because it allows the learning circuit to represent more complex patterns. However, it can also make the circuit more difficult to train, because the optimization landscape that needs to be navigated to find the best set of parameters can become more complex and may include more local minima. In the quantum case, there is also the phenomenon of \"barren plateaus\" where the optimization landscape becomes flat, making it difficult for gradient-based methods to find a good solution."

        "**What means expressibility of a quantum circuit?**\n",
        "\n",
        "In the context of quantum computing, the expressibility of a quantum circuit refers to the variety or range of quantum states that the circuit can generate or the set of unitary operations it can perform, given a set of parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Expressibility is an important property to consider when designing quantum circuits for quantum algorithms, especially variational quantum algorithms. A more expressive quantum circuit has the potential to represent a wider range of quantum states or unitary transformations, which may make it more powerful or versatile for certain tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, there is a trade-off between expressibility and other properties of the circuit:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Trainability**: While having a highly expressive quantum circuit may sound beneficial, it can actually make the circuit harder to train. This is due to the so-called \"Barren Plateaus\" phenomenon, where the cost function landscape that you're trying to optimize becomes flat in all directions for highly expressive circuits, making it difficult for gradient-based optimization methods to find a good solution.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Noise sensitivity**: More expressive quantum circuits typically involve a greater number of quantum gates, which can make the circuit more susceptible to noise and errors in a real quantum device.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Computational cost**: More expressive quantum circuits can require a larger number of qubits and quantum operations, which increases the computational cost of running and simulating the circuit.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, while the expressibility of a quantum circuit is an important factor in quantum algorithm design, it's only one piece of the puzzle. Other factors like trainability, noise sensitivity, and computational cost also need to be taken into account."

In more detail, you start with an arrangement of beam splitters and phase shifters that form a linear optical network. You inject a number of indistinguishable single photons into this network. The photons then interact with the network and with each other due to quantum interference and finally are detected at the output. The task is to compute the probabilities of different detection patterns.\n",

This is because the distance between the transistors gets smaller, and the electrons have to travel a shorter distance to switch them on and off.\n",

        "QM. The eldest one, historically speaking, is due to von Neumann in essence, and is formulated using the language of Hilbert spaces and the spectral theory of unbounded operators. A more recent and mature formulation was developed by several authors in the attempt to solve quantum field theory problems in mathematical physics. It relies on the theory of abstract algebras (*-algebras and C* -algebras) that are built mimicking the operator algebras defined and studied, again, by von Neumann (nowadays known as W* -algebras or von Neumann algebras), but freed from the Hilbert-space structure. The core result is the celebrated GNS theorem (after Gelfand, Najmark and Segal), that we will prove in Chap. 14. The newer formulation can be considered an extension of the former one, in a very precise sense that we shall not go into here, also by virtue of the novel physical context it introduces and by the possibility of treating physical systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom, i.e. quantum fields. In particular, this second formulation makes precise sense of the demand for locality and covariance of relativistic quantum field theories, and allows to extend quantum field theories to a curved spacetime.\"\n",

        "The main difference between Shor's algorithm and Gidney's work is that Shor's algorithm is specifically designed for integer factorization, while Gidney's work is more general and can be used to solve the discrete logarithm problem as well. Additionally, Shor's algorithm is a probabilistic algorithm, while Gidney's work is a deterministic algorithm. This means that Shor's algorithm may not always be able to factor an integer, while Gidney's work is guaranteed to be able to solve the discrete logarithm problem if the correct input is given.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the work of Peter Shor and Craig Gidney are both important results in quantum computing. Shor's algorithm shows that it is possible to factor large integers in polynomial time using a quantum computer, while Gidney's work shows that it is also possible to solve the discrete logarithm problem in polynomial time using a quantum computer. These results have major implications for cryptography, as many of the most widely used cryptographic systems are based on the difficulty of factoring large integers or solving the discrete logarithm problem.\n",

        "* The kernel of a matrix is the set of all vectors that are orthogonal to all the eigenvectors of the matrix with eigenvalue 0. In other words, it is the set of all vectors that do not change under the action of the matrix.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The spectral gap of a matrix is related to the kernel of the matrix in the following way: the larger the spectral gap, the smaller the dimension of the kernel. This is because if the spectral gap is large, then the eigenvalues of the matrix are well-separated, which means that there are fewer vectors that are orthogonal to all the eigenvectors with eigenvalue 0.\n",
        "\n",
        "* This connection between kernel and spectral gap has implications for machine learning. Kernel methods are a type of machine learning algorithm that use kernels to compute the similarity between two data points. The spectral gap of the kernel matrix is related to the generalization performance of kernel methods. In general, kernel methods with a larger spectral gap have better generalization performance.\n",

In general, graph kernels with a larger spectral gap have better quality.\n",

        "\n",
        "In linear algebra, the rank of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns in the matrix. This concept is important because it provides insight into the structure of the matrix, its null space, column space, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "A \"low-rank\" matrix is a matrix where the rank is significantly less than the number of rows or columns. For example, if you have a 1000x1000 matrix (which could potentially have a rank up to 1000), but its rank is only 10, that matrix would be considered low-rank.\n",
        "\n",
        "Low-rank matrices are useful in many applications, including machine learning and data analysis. They are often used in techniques like principal component analysis (PCA) or singular value decomposition (SVD), where a high-dimensional dataset is approximated by a lower-dimensional one. This is possible because the data can often be accurately represented in a lower-dimensional space (i.e., with a low-rank matrix), which simplifies analysis and reduces computational complexity.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) are both techniques used in linear algebra and data analysis, but they are used for somewhat different purposes and their computations are based on different principles. Here's a comparison:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. The number of principal components is less than or equal to the number of original variables. The transformation is done in such a way that the first principal component has the largest possible variance (i.e., accounts for as much of the variability in the data as possible), and each succeeding component, in turn, has the highest variance possible under the constraint that it is orthogonal to (i.e., uncorrelated with) the preceding components. PCA is often used in exploratory data analysis and for making predictive models.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)** is a method of decomposing a matrix into three other matrices. Given a matrix A, you can decompose it into three matrices U, Σ, and V^T such that A = UΣV^T. The U and V matrices contain orthogonal vectors (the left and right singular vectors), and Σ contains the singular values, which can be thought of as the \"strength\" or \"importance\" of the corresponding singular vectors. The SVD is a fundamental operation in linear algebra, and it has a wide range of applications. It's used in solving systems of linear equations, inverting matrices, and is the backbone of many data reduction techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "The relationship between PCA and SVD is as follows: PCA can be solved by applying the SVD on the data matrix (more precisely, on the covariance or correlation matrix of the data). The principal components resulting from PCA are equivalent to the right singular vectors resulting from the SVD (after some scaling). In other words, PCA can be considered a special case of SVD.\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite their relationship, the methods are typically used in different contexts: **PCA is mainly used in the context of data analysis, for tasks like dimensionality reduction and extracting useful features from data, while SVD is a more general tool in linear algebra with a wider range of applications**."

        "The condition number of a matrix in linear algebra is a measure of the matrix's sensitivity to numerical errors. This number is used in the context of numerical analysis to understand the stability of a problem, specifically in the context of linear systems of equations.\n",
        "\n",
        "The condition number is calculated as the ratio of the largest singular value of a matrix to the smallest singular value. In other words, it gives us a measure of how much the output value of the function can change for a small change in the input.\n",
        "\n",
        "If a matrix has a low condition number, it means the matrix is well-conditioned, implying that the system of equations has a unique solution, and this solution can be found accurately by numerical methods. The solution will not significantly change even if the input is perturbed slightly.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, if the condition number is high, the matrix is said to be ill-conditioned. This indicates that the system is sensitive to small changes in the input, and even a slight change in the input could produce a large change in the result. Thus, the solution may not be accurately computable due to rounding errors and other numerical errors.\n",

        "As a rough rule of thumb, if the condition number κ(A) exceeds 1/ε, where ε is the machine precision (around 10^-16 for double-precision floating-point arithmetic), then the matrix is considered ill-conditioned. This is because the precision of the numerical computations might be less than the number of digits in the condition number. For example, a condition number of 10^12 would indicate that up to 12 digits of precision could be lost in the computation.\n",

        "In practice, condition numbers in the range of 1-10 are generally considered good, 10-100 might be cause for some concern, and 100+ is usually considered problematic, although these thresholds are rather arbitrary and can depend heavily on the specific context and precision of the computations.\n",

        "Contrary to Kurt Behnke’s answer, this is not true by definition. It’s a profound open question in mathematics.\n",

        "\n",
        "But it’s possible to say more than that. From reading popular articles, many people have the vague impression that a quantum computer could just try every possible solution in parallel. And if that’s all you know about them, then it’s indeed a mystery why they couldn’t solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time!\n",
        "\n",
        "The central difficulty is that, for a computer to be useful, at some point you need to measure it to observe an answer. And if you just measured an equal superposition over all possible answers, not having done anything else, the rules of QM dictate that you’ll just see a random answer. And of course, if you’d just wanted a random answer, you could’ve picked one yourself with a lot less trouble!\n",
        "\n",
        "So the name of the game, with every quantum algorithm, is somehow orchestrating a pattern of constructive and destructive quantum interference that boosts the probability of the correct answer (even though you yourself don’t know in advance which answer is the correct one!), and that does so efficiently. Famously, in 1994 Peter Shor showed how to do that for the problem of factoring integers, and a few related problems in number theory—but he was able to do so only by exploiting extremely special structure in those problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "For more “generic” search problems, like NP-complete problems, the best we generally know is Grover’s algorithm: a quantum algorithm that’s able to find the right answer (i.e., concentrate a large fraction of the amplitude on that answer) in roughly the square root of the number of steps that would be needed classically. So you get some speedup, but not an exponential one.\n",
        "\n",
        "But we also know that, if your search problem is a “black box”—i.e., you can just pick candidate solutions and evaluate if they’re correct, and you don’t know anything more about the problem’s structure—then Grover’s algorithm is the best that even a quantum computer can do. This is the content of the so-called BBBV (Bennett, Bernstein, Brassard, Vazirani) Theorem, which has several proofs, all of them crucially relying on the linearity of unitary evolution. The BBBV Theorem gives a fundamental explanation for why any fast quantum algorithm for NP-complete problems would have to look very different from anything that we know today—much like a fast classical algorithm would have to*."

Categories can be thought of as an abstract way to represent mathematical concepts and their relationships.\n",
