        "\"There are (at least) two possible ways to formulate precisely (i.e. mathematically) elementary\n",
        "QM. The eldest one, historically speaking, is due to von Neumann in essence, and is formulated using the language of Hilbert spaces and the spectral theory of unbounded operators. A more recent and mature formulation was developed by several authors in the attempt to solve quantum field theory problems in mathematical physics. It relies on the theory of abstract algebras (*-algebras and C* -algebras) that are built mimicking the operator algebras defined and studied, again, by von Neumann (nowadays known as W* -algebras or von Neumann algebras), but freed from the Hilbert-space structure. The core result is the celebrated GNS theorem (after Gelfand, Najmark and Segal), that we will prove in Chap. 14. The newer formulation can be considered an extension of the former one, in a very precise sense that we shall not go into here, also by virtue of the novel physical context it introduces and by the possibility of treating physical systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom, i.e. quantum fields. In particular, this second formulation makes precise sense of the demand for locality and covariance of relativistic quantum field theories, and allows to extend quantum field theories to a curved spacetime.\"\n",

Named after Paul Ehrenfest, who proved it in 1927, it demonstrates how the expectation values (average values) of quantum observables (like position and momentum) evolve with time. **Under some circumstances, when quantum effects are small, these expectation values follow trajectories similar to classical mechanics.**\n",

The theorem states that the distribution function is constant along the trajectories of the system. That is, the total phase space volume is conserved.\n",

        "A mixed state and a product state are two different types of quantum states that arise in quantum mechanics and quantum information theory, each with its own distinct properties and interpretations.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Mixed State**: A mixed state describes a statistical mixture of different quantum states, each with a certain probability. Mathematically, a mixed state is represented by a density matrix, which is a positive-semidefinite Hermitian operator with trace 1. If a system is in a mixed state, it means we have some classical uncertainty about which specific quantum state it's in. For example, a system might be in state |0⟩ with probability 1/2 and in state |1⟩ with probability 1/2. This would correspond to the mixed state represented by the density matrix ρ = 1/2|0⟩⟨0| + 1/2|1⟩⟨1|.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Product State**: A product state refers to a state of a composite system that can be written as the tensor product of states of its subsystems. For example, if you have a two-qubit system and the first qubit is in state |0⟩ and the second qubit is in state |1⟩, the overall state of the system is the product state |0⟩⊗|1⟩, often written as |01⟩. A product state implies that there are no correlations between the subsystems, i.e., the subsystems are not entangled. If a state of a composite system cannot be written as a tensor product of states of its subsystems, it's called an entangled state.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, in summary, the difference lies in what each state represents: a mixed state represents classical uncertainty about which pure state a system is in, while a product state represents a separable (i.e., non-entangled) state of a composite system. Notably, these are not mutually exclusive: you can have a mixed state of product states, for example."

        "⚛ In quantum field theory, the concept of global phase in a one-qubit system can be understood in the context of symmetries, particularly the global U(1) phase symmetry. U(1) is a mathematical group that represents a continuous symmetry associated with global phase transformations. We can outline how quantum field theory incorporates this symmetry to explain the concept:\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Global U(1) Phase Symmetry:\n",
        "In quantum field theory, we work with fields and operators that are often complex-valued. The global U(1) phase symmetry refers to the ability to multiply the entire quantum state by a complex phase factor without affecting the physical observables. Mathematically, for a one-qubit system, the global U(1) phase transformation can be represented as follows:\n",
        "|ψ⟩ → e^(iθ)|ψ⟩ where, θ is a real number representing the phase transformation.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ No Observable Impact: The key feature of this global phase transformation is that it does not change the probabilities of measurement outcomes or any other physically observable quantities. The global phase is, in a sense, \"gauged out\" because it affects both the quantum state and its complex conjugate, so it cancels out in terms of probabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Conservation of Probability: The conservation of probability is ensured by the U(1) phase symmetry. The probabilities of measuring a qubit in any state remain constant under global phase transformations. This property is closely related to the conservation of probability in quantum systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Interference and Relative Phases: While the global phase itself is not physically meaningful, relative phases between different quantum states are significant. Quantum field theory allows for interference effects, which arise from relative phases between states. This interference is crucial in understanding phenomena like quantum entanglement and quantum superposition.\n",
        "\n",
        "✴ In summary, quantum field theory incorporates the global U(1) phase symmetry to explain the concept of global phase in a one-qubit system. This symmetry allows for phase transformations that do not affect the probabilities of measurement outcomes, highlighting the importance of relative phases in quantum interference effects and quantum phenomena.\n"

        "Shadow tomography, also known as X-ray phase-contrast imaging or phase tomography, is a technique used to create detailed three-dimensional images of an object's internal structure. It is primarily employed in the field of medical imaging but also finds applications in materials science and other areas.\n",
        "\n",
        "Traditional X-ray imaging relies on the attenuation of X-rays as they pass through different tissues or materials, resulting in a two-dimensional projection image that shows variations in X-ray absorption. However, some tissues or materials have similar absorption properties, making it challenging to distinguish between them based solely on their attenuation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Shadow tomography overcomes this limitation by exploiting the phase shift of X-rays as they pass through an object. When X-rays encounter a boundary between two materials with different refractive indices, they undergo a phase shift. This phase shift contains valuable information about the object's internal structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "To perform shadow tomography, a coherent X-ray source, such as a synchrotron or an X-ray tube, is used. The X-rays pass through the object and are collected by a detector placed behind it. The collected X-rays contain both intensity and phase information.\n",
        "\n",
        "The key to shadow tomography lies in extracting the phase information from the intensity measurements. This is typically achieved by using specialized techniques such as interferometry or grating-based methods. These methods create interference patterns that encode the phase information, which can then be computationally reconstructed into a three-dimensional image.\n",
        "\n",
        "The resulting shadow tomography image provides not only information about the X-ray absorption but also about the object's refractive index distribution and other structural features. This enables visualization of fine details, such as boundaries between tissues or subtle density variations, which may not be easily distinguishable in traditional X-ray images.\n",
        "\n",
        "Shadow tomography has the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and enhance our understanding of complex biological and materials systems. However, it currently requires advanced X-ray sources and specialized techniques, limiting its widespread availability in clinical settings. Nevertheless, ongoing research and technological advancements aim to make shadow tomography more accessible and applicable in various fields."

Quantum state tomography aims to reconstruct or characterize the complete quantum state of a system by performing measurements on the system in different bases or using various observables.\n",

By repeating this process for a sufficiently large number of initial states and measurements, it becomes possible to reconstruct the complete quantum state of the system through computational methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "The reconstructed quantum state provides valuable information about the system's properties, such as its purity, entanglement, coherence, and other relevant characteristics. This information is crucial for understanding and characterizing quantum systems, as well as for verifying the performance of quantum devices and protocols.\n",

        "It's important to note that quantum state tomography can be a challenging task due to various factors, such as noise, imperfections in measurements, and the exponential growth of the state space with the number of quantum bits (qubits). Researchers continually work on improving the efficiency and accuracy of quantum state tomography techniques to overcome these challenges."

In essence, it's a method used to figure out the unknown quantum state of a system.

In the simplest case, for a single qubit, the density matrix is a 2x2 Hermitian matrix that is positive semi-definite and has trace 1. The generalization to multiple qubits is a matrix that is 2^n x 2^n (where n is the number of qubits), but with the same properties.\n",

The idea is to break down the evolution into a sequence of smaller evolutions, each of which is under a single term of the Hamiltonian.

While the classical Lanczos method has exponential cost in the system size to represent the Krylov states for quantum systems, our efficient quantum algorithm achieves this in polynomial time and memory. The construction presented is exact in the sense that the resulting Krylov space is identical to that of the Lanczos method, so the only approximation with respect to the exact method is due to finite sample noise. This is possible because, unlike previous quantum Krylov methods, our algorithm does not require simulating real or imaginary time evolution. We provide an explicit error bound for the resulting ground state energy estimate in the presence of noise.\n",

        "\n",
        "Quantum error correction is a set of techniques for protecting quantum information from errors due to decoherence and other quantum noise. Here's a high-level summary:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Encoding**: The first step in quantum error correction is to encode the quantum information. Rather than storing a quantum bit of information (a \"qubit\") in a single physical qubit, we store it in multiple physical qubits. This is done in such a way that, even if some of the physical qubits are corrupted by noise, the original quantum information can still be recovered. This encoding is done using a quantum error-correcting code. There are many different types of quantum error-correcting codes, each with its strengths and weaknesses.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Syndrome measurement**: Once the quantum information has been encoded, the next step is to periodically check for errors. This is done by performing a syndrome measurement, which is a special kind of quantum measurement that can detect whether an error has occurred, and if so, what kind of error it was. Importantly, this measurement does not disturb the encoded quantum information.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Error correction**: If the syndrome measurement indicates that an error has occurred, the next step is to perform an error correction. This involves applying a series of quantum gates to the physical qubits to correct the error, based on the result of the syndrome measurement.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Repeat**: Because quantum systems are always subject to noise, this process of syndrome measurement and error correction needs to be repeated periodically to keep the errors in check.\n",
        "\n",
        "Challenges:\n",
        "\n",
        "* It's worth noting that the whole process of quantum error correction requires a significant overhead in terms of additional physical qubits and quantum operations. This is a major challenge in the development of large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers.\n",
        "\n",
        "* It's also worth noting that, although quantum error correction can protect against many types of errors, it cannot protect against all possible errors. In particular, **it's assumed that the errors are relatively rare and do not all occur at once, and that they are independent and identically distributed across the physical qubits**. **If these assumptions are violated, then quantum error correction may not be able to correct the errors**. This is another major challenge in the field of quantum error correction."

        "In quantum computing, Abelian groups are used to describe the symmetry of a quantum system. Symmetry is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, and it refers to the idea that a physical system will remain unchanged under certain transformations. For example, the symmetry of a quantum system may be described by a group of rotations, translations, or reflections. Abelian groups are used to describe the symmetry of a quantum system because they have the useful property of being commutative, meaning that the order in which the transformations are applied does not affect the outcome. This property makes it possible to use Abelian groups to describe the symmetries of a quantum system in a way that is mathematically tractable and easy to work with."

In fact, with collaborators we have proven that the color code is equivalent to a surface code (paper) up to a geometrically local unitary (one which only makes nearby qubits interact). One can think by analogy of the surface code* as a napkin with two rough and two smooth sides and the color code as folding this napkin along its diagonal. Because in the folded napkin, there are new things that are now close, it is possible to do more logical gates \"transversally\". This is good because it keeps errors from propagating and is relatively easy. However, the color code needs more qubits to interact in each stabilizer so ends up leading to a lower noise threshold. So one can say that although very similar, each code has its advantages and disadvantages.\n",

        " I am also frustrated by us and the media representing these anyon simulations as a \"step towards fault-tolerance\". Certainly topological codes are inspired by the physics of anyons and there are direct analogies between how those codes work and are realized and these simulations. I also have no doubt that certain aspects of these simulations have some degree of error robustness. But my understanding is that once you get serious about turning such simulations into a form of fault-tolerance appropriate for our devices and then try to optimize its realization you end up with the surface code. So while thinking about the physics of error-correction from this perspective might be useful and there are myriad mathematical similarities between what is going on in these simulations and topological codes, I think it is misleading/wrong to claim that performing these simulations is taking us any closer to fault-tolerance (whether the surface code or a different form of it). People keep telling me that I am misunderstanding this (and maybe I am!) but I have not been convinced of that yet.\n",
        "\n",
        "my objection, which might be different from Cody's, is that the title of this blog post suggests that this experiment is getting us closer to realizing universal fault-tolerant quantum computers. In particular, when we say it is a step closer to improved quantum computers, it makes it sound like this approach is somehow a step on our roadmap for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computers, or that it is going to make our ultimate goal easier or something like that. That is reading between the lines a little bit, but it is how it sounds to me. Is that actually true? Or is this in the category of \"nice demonstration, but not something we're going to follow up on, and thus not a step towards us improving quantum computers other than in the very broad sense that it helps test hardware capabilities like most physics team experiments do\"? My understanding is that nothing about this experiment is likely to change anything about how we are planning to realize fault-tolerance. Maybe that is incorrect, or it is correct and I am just reading too much into the implications of statements like the title. It would be nice to understand this better.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main sense in which the non-abelian anyons are useful for fault tolerance is that they are isomorphic to twists in the surface code, and you can use twists to store logical qubits. But we already knew about twists independent of this work e.g. from https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04673 so I don't know what it adds on the fault tolerance side.\n",
        "\n",
        "I did give a presentation to the authors of our abelian paper on how to do it fault tolerantly (they were technically \"using\" a surface code, but they were preparing it entirely unitarily which is not fault tolerant; you have to use measurements for everything). They weren't so interested I think, because the measurement version is harder and maybe also because they didn't consider it \"really doing it\" in the same way. I actually did run some quick shots of my versions of the circuits on the device back when pink was in M2 shape, and it worked, in that I got non-zero signal (the error rate was close to max but not max). I wasn't doing adept or etc or etc; if an experimentalist did it it would have been better. Also I now have much better versions of the circuit, which are described in https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07395 .\n",
        "\n",
        "My point was that if you interpret TQC as broadly (\"you have things that act like anyons\") then this is demonstrating something interesting (multiparticle entangled EC state, FT gates on that state).  But I also agree with Ryan in that I think the blog post does not convey this well.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fair enough, I'm just trying to put forth a perspective on why it is fine to say this is an interesting experiment in topological quantum computation.  And if you want some idea of how it might lead to noise protection, yes  https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9912040 which was expanded upon in https://arxiv.org/abs/0907.3988\n",

But I don't think any of that really justifies the framing of the blog post title, which to me suggests that this is moving us closer to building a fault-tolerant quantum computer as opposed to exploring the error robustness of anyon simulation."

First, the study of the problem sheds some light on what it is that quantum computers are really good at. Second, the ability to solve HSP for non-Abelian groups in polynomial time would enable us to extend the set of problems on which quantum computers offer substantial performance advantage. In this introductory talk, I will recap essential concepts from group theory before defining the Hidden Subgroup Problem and describing the quantum algorithm that solves it quickly.

This limited information makes it difficult to directly extract the subgroup.\n",

        "3. **Time Evolution**: Time evolution in quantum computing typically refers to how a quantum state changes over time according to the Schrödinger equation. It is often used to simulate physical systems in quantum simulations.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Phase Estimation**: Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) is a fundamental algorithm in quantum computing which estimates the phase (or eigenvalue) of an eigenvector of a unitary operator. It's a key component in many quantum algorithms, such as Shor's algorithm and quantum simulation algorithms.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Filtering the Zero Eigenvalue**: This refers to the process of isolating or eliminating states with zero eigenvalues. It can be a way of refining results or simplifying calculations in quantum algorithms.\n",

Suppose you keep the circuit depth constant at, say, a relatively shallow three layers, as you increase the number of qubits. You won’t get much entanglement, and the output will still be amenable to classical simulation. On the other hand, if you increase the circuit depth to keep up with the growing number of qubits, the cumulative effects of gate errors will wash out the entanglement, and the output will again become easy to simulate classically."

        "The Anatomy of Quantum Advantage\n",
        "\n",
        "The best known quantum advantage comes from the quantum Fourier transform, used in both Shor's and Grover's algorithms. Here is why.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Fourier transform approximates a given periodic signal with simpler periodic signals with a given set of frequencies. It is used in image, video, and radio transmissions, to name just a few areas we interact with everyday. As the image shows,  if we apply the (inverse) Fourier transform to a signal that has a frequency of 4.7 we get increasingly better approximations for its frequency. With three qubits, we have 8 frequencies available (0 through 7). The first step indicates that the frequency is in the second half of the range (those frequencies have a higher probability). The second step assigns a higher probability to the first half of the second half (4 and 5). The third and last step gives more probability to 5, with the ratios of the probabilities of 4 and 5 being correlated with the decimal part of 4.7.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is an amazing procedure, a probabilistic version of a binary search (for an integer frequency it acts like a binary search, as I pointed out in a previous post).\n",
        "\n",
        "The fast Fourier transform (FFT) is a version of the algorithm that is extremely efficient. If you look at its implementation, it pretty much makes every step look like a quantum gate (a combination of Hadamard and Phase gates). Its structure is the essence of how quantum computing works. Even better, the quantum implementation takes advantage of quantum parallelism, enabled by decomposing operations by digit/qubit, to make the transformation exponentially faster.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is worth understanding the details of how the advantage works. Decomposing by digits is an essential ingredient, that coupled with interference allows quantum parallelism to provide an exponential speed-up. The combinatorial structure is the key, and the place where other advantage sources may be found in the future. I also think the discrete sinc distribution can play a bigger role in quantum computing.\n",

The performance matches previous demonstrations using superconducting quantum technologies, but importantly integrates the core components into a single device and works at higher magnetic fields and temperatures, which is critical for the practical use of this technology.

        "\n",
        "Quantum annealing is a quantum computing technique used to find the minimum value of a given objective function over a defined set of possible solutions. It draws inspiration from classical annealing, a process in which a system is gradually cooled to find its lowest energy state. The hope in quantum annealing is to leverage quantum properties, such as superposition and tunneling, to more efficiently explore the solution space and find the ground state, which represents the minimum of the objective function.\n",
        "\n",
        "Connectivity plays an essential role in this process. Let's understand this with a few key points:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Local Minima and Global Minima**: In complex optimization problems, there are often many local minima. Finding the global minimum (or a sufficiently good approximation of it) is the main challenge. High connectivity means that the system can more easily explore the solution space, jumping from one potential solution to another and avoiding getting trapped in local minima.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Quantum Tunneling**: One of the primary advantages of quantum annealing over classical annealing is quantum tunneling. Tunneling allows the system to \"pass through\" barriers between states, meaning that the system can more easily escape local minima and move towards the global minimum. If the quantum system's connectivity is low, the benefit from quantum tunneling can be diminished.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Effective Exploration of Solution Space**: In a highly connected system, any given qubit (quantum bit) is more likely to interact with many other qubits. <font color=\"blue\">This allows for a richer exploration of the solution space. With fewer connections, the qubits are limited in their interactions, making the exploration less effective.</font>\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Scaling Issues**: <font color=\"blue\">as the system size increases, maintaining high connectivity becomes more challenging. The difficulty in keeping high connectivity in larger systems is one reason why quantum annealing's efficiency decreases for more complex NP-hard problems</font>. The sparser the connectivity, the less able the system is to effectively leverage quantum effects.\n",

        "5. **Error Correction and Noise**: Highly connected quantum systems can be more susceptible to certain types of errors or noise. So, while high connectivity can aid in the exploration of solution space, it can also introduce challenges in terms of maintaining the coherence and reliability of the quantum information.\n",

The rule ensures that for certain types of quantum gates (those that generate rotations), the gradient of the expectation value of a quantum circuit with respect to a parameter can be computed exactly, regardless of the number of qubits or the complexity of the circuit. This rule allows the derivative of a quantum circuit output with respect to its parameters to be computed in terms of circuit evaluations. Given a parameterized quantum gate (say, a rotation gate), the derivative of the expectation value of an observable with respect to the parameter can be computed as the difference between the expectation values of the observable for two slightly different values of the parameter. These \"shifted\" parameter values are typically chosen to be a small positive or negative shift from the original parameter value.

This method is efficient in terms of the number of quantum operations required, especially for circuits with many parameters but a single output (as is common in quantum machine learning models). However, it requires the ability to run quantum operations in reverse, as well as the ability to store quantum states, which can be challenging to implement on near-term quantum devices.\n",

        "\n",
        "\"Backpropagation scaling\" usually refers to techniques that manage the magnitudes of gradients during the process of backpropagation, which is used to train neural networks. Proper scaling is important because it can impact the speed and effectiveness of learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are two common scaling issues that may arise during backpropagation:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Vanishing gradients:** When deep neural networks are trained, gradients of the loss function can become very small. As a result, weight updates during training become insignificant, and the network takes a very long time to learn, if it can learn at all. This problem is particularly common with activation functions like the sigmoid or hyperbolic tangent, which squish a large input space into a small output range.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Exploding gradients:** Conversely, gradients can also become very large, leading to large updates to the weights and causing the model to oscillate around the optimal solution, or even to diverge entirely. This is often a problem in recurrent neural networks (RNNs).\n",
        "\n",
        "Various techniques have been proposed to mitigate these issues:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Gradient clipping:** This is a common technique to prevent exploding gradients. If the norm of the gradient exceeds a certain threshold, we scale it back to prevent it from getting too large.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Weight initialization:** Properly initializing the weights can prevent gradients from vanishing or exploding too quickly. For example, Xavier/Glorot and He initialization are strategies that consider the sizes of the input and output layers.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Choice of activation function:** The choice of activation function can help alleviate the vanishing gradients problem. For example, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) and its variants (like Leaky ReLU and Parametric ReLU) are commonly used because they do not saturate for positive inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Batch normalization:** This technique normalizes the activations of each layer to prevent the distribution of inputs to each layer from changing too much during training, which can help mitigate both vanishing and exploding gradients.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Use of optimizers:** Certain optimization algorithms like RMSProp, Adam, and Nadam can adaptively scale learning rates to mitigate both exploding and vanishing gradients.\n",

        "\n",
        "In the context of quantum computing and quantum machine learning, \"circuit expressivity\" is a term often used to describe the ability of a quantum circuit to represent a wide range of quantum operations or states. To measure the expressivity of a quantum circuit, researchers typically consider a variety of factors, including the diversity of the unitary operations the circuit can generate and the complexity of the quantum states it can prepare. Here are a few methods that might be used to measure the expressivity of a quantum circuit:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Entangling Power**: The ability of a circuit to create entangled states is often used as a measure of its expressivity. More expressive circuits can create a wider variety of complex, entangled states. The entangling power can be quantified using various measures, such as the entanglement entropy or entanglement witness.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Expressive Power of Gates**: The variety and expressive power of the gates used in the circuit can be a significant factor. Universal gate sets can generate any unitary operation, and thus have high expressivity. The specific combination of gates and the connectivity of the quantum hardware can also influence the expressivity of a circuit.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Circuit Depth and Width**: The depth (number of sequential gate operations) and the width (number of qubits) of a circuit can influence its expressivity. Deeper and wider circuits can potentially represent more complex unitary operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Volume of the Unitary Group**: Analyze the volume of the unitary group that the circuit can generate. This can be measured using various metrics, such as the 2-design or the t-design, which quantify how closely the set of unitary operations generated by the circuit approximates the entire unitary group.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Variational Expressivity**: In variational quantum algorithms, the expressivity can be measured by the ability of the variational form to represent a wide range of quantum states. This can be quantified using metrics like the expressivity of the ansatz, which measures the diversity of the states that can be generated by varying the parameters of the variational form.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Schatten Norm**: The Schatten norm of the difference between the unitary matrices generated by the circuit and a target unitary operation can be used as a measure of the expressivity. Smaller values of the Schatten norm indicate higher expressivity.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Fidelity**: The fidelity between the states generated by the circuit and a set of target states can be used to measure expressivity. Higher fidelity indicates that the circuit can more closely approximate the target states, suggesting higher expressivity.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Spectral Gap**: The spectral gap of the Hamiltonian that describes the quantum circuit can also be a factor in its expressivity. Circuits associated with Hamiltonians with small spectral gaps might be able to represent more complex quantum operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **Loschmidt Echo**: The Loschmidt echo, which measures the reversibility of the evolution generated by the circuit, can also be used as a measure of expressivity. Circuits with smaller Loschmidt echoes might be more expressive, as they can generate more irreversible, complex dynamics.\n",
        "  * The Loschmidt echo is a measure of the revival occurring when an imperfect time-reversal procedure is applied to a complex quantum system. http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Loschmidt_echo\n",

        "\n",

This theorem tells us that the complexity class PSPACE, which contains all problems that can be solved by a polynomial space Turing machine, is contained in the complexity class EXPTIME, which contains all problems that can be solved by an exponential time Turing machine. Dimensionality measures are a powerful tool for studying the complexity of computational problems. They can be used to bound the resource requirements of algorithms, and to study the relationships between different complexity classes.\n",

        "  * Common distance measures in quantum information theory: here, \"distance measure\" is used in an informal sense, only three of the quantities introduced below are actual \"distances\" in the sense of a metric. First, and maybe most naturally, we can equip the set $\\mathcal{S}\\left(\\mathbb{C}^d\\right)$ with the (for convenience scaled) trace norm $I_i / 2$. This allows us to measure the difference between two quantum states $\\rho, \\sigma \\in$ $S\\left(\\mathbb{C}^d\\right)$ via the trace distance $\\left.\\left.\\|\\rho-\\sigma\\|_1 / 2=\\operatorname{tr} \\| \\rho-\\sigma\\right]\\right] / 2$. In fact, this distance is not only intuitive from a mathematical perspective, it also has an operational interpretation: The maximal success probability in distinghuishing $\\rho, \\sigma \\in \\mathcal{S}\\left(\\mathbb{C}^d\\right)$, assuming that either of the two is prepared with probability $1 / 2$, by performing a 2-outcome measurement on a single copy of the unknown state is given by $\\sup _{E \\in \\mathcal{E}(\\mathrm{C})} \\operatorname{tr}[E(\\rho-\\sigma)]+\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{\\|\\rho-\\sigma\\|_1+1}{2}$ (see, e.g., $[17$, Chapter 9$]$ for a derivation).\n",

        "  * The trace norm (also known as the nuclear norm) is a specific case of Schatten p-norm when p=1. It's the sum of singular values of a matrix. Sometimes, in the context of regularizing machine learning models, these norms are considered to constrain the learning capacity of the model. The trace of the Fisher Information Matrix can give a measure of the average sensitivity of the log-likelihood to parameter changes.\n",

If each of these axes is re-scaled to have unit variance, then the Mahalanobis distance corresponds to standard Euclidean distance in the transformed space. The Mahalanobis distance is thus unitless and scale-invariant, and takes into account the correlations of the data set. In statistics, the covariance matrix of the data is sometimes used to define a distance metric called Mahalanobis distance. The Mahalanobis distance does not satisfy the triangle inequality because it can be zero even if the two points are not the same. This can happen if the covariance matrix is singular. It is often used in multivariate anomaly detection, classification, and regression. [Mahalanobis distance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahalanobis_distance) is useful when dealing with variables measured in different scales (so the units of measure become standardized) and also, in order to avoid correlation issues between these variables.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **L2 Norm (Ridge Regression - \\( p = 2 \\)):**\n",
        "   - Ridge regression adds a regularization term equal to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients (L2 norm) to the loss function. The computational complexity of ridge regression is similar to ordinary linear regression. The solving process involves matrix operations that are computationally intensive (like inversion), but these operations don't significantly increase in complexity with the addition of the L2 term.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **L1 Norm (Lasso Regression - \\( p = 1 \\)):**\n",
        "   - Lasso regression uses the absolute value of the coefficients (L1 norm) as the regularization term. The main computational challenge with Lasso is that the absolute value function is not differentiable at zero, which complicates the optimization process. Specialized algorithms like coordinate descent are used, and the complexity can be higher compared to ridge regression, especially for high-dimensional data. However, this increased complexity is more due to the nature of the L1 norm rather than its size.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Higher p-norms:**\n",
        "   - In practice, norms higher than L2 are rarely used in linear regression. Theoretically, as \\( p \\) increases beyond 2, the optimization problem can become more challenging due to the increasing non-linearity and non-convexity of the norm. This could potentially lead to higher computational complexity, but such cases are not common in standard linear regression problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the increase in computational complexity with different p-norms in linear regression is less about the size of \\( p \\) and more about the mathematical and computational characteristics of the norms themselves. L1 and L2 norms are the most commonly used, with L1 (Lasso) generally posing more computational challenges due to its non-differentiability at zero. Higher p-norms are not standard in linear regression and could potentially introduce more complex optimization challenges.\n",

        "As \\( p \\) increases, the behavior of this norm changes:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Increasing Non-Linearity:**\n",
        "   - For \\( p < 1 \\), the p-norm is non-convex. As \\( p \\) approaches 1, the function becomes linear in nature (the L1 norm or Manhattan norm). Beyond \\( p = 1 \\), including the commonly used \\( p = 2 \\) (Euclidean norm), the function is convex but exhibits increasing non-linearity as \\( p \\) increases.\n",
        "   - The non-linearity arises because higher powers increasingly magnify larger components of the vector more than smaller ones. For instance, in the case of \\( p = 2 \\), squaring each component treats all components equally in terms of their sign but not in terms of their magnitude. As \\( p \\) increases further, this effect becomes more pronounced, leading to a function that responds very non-linearly to changes in the input vector.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Non-Convexity for \\( p > 1 \\):**\n",
        "   - For \\( p > 1 \\), the p-norms are always convex. This convexity is a crucial property for many optimization problems, including those in machine learning, as it ensures that any local minimum is also a global minimum.\n",
        "   - However, as \\( p \\) increases, the shape of the function becomes more \"peaky\" or \"sharp\" around the axes. This can be intuitively understood: for very large \\( p \\), the p-norm is heavily influenced by the largest component of the vector, almost ignoring the smaller components. This behavior can lead to a function that, while still convex, has very steep gradients near the axes, making optimization more challenging.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Practical Implications:**\n",
        "   - In optimization problems, such as those in machine learning, these properties have significant implications. Non-linear, sharp functions can lead to optimization challenges, such as difficulty in finding the global minimum due to steep gradients or flat regions.\n",
        "   - Moreover, the computational cost of evaluating higher p-norms can be significant, as it involves raising each component of the vector to a high power and then taking a root, operations that are more computationally intensive than those required for lower p-norms.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the increase in non-linearity and the specific convexity shape of higher p-norms are inherent to their mathematical definition. These properties influence their practical use in fields like machine learning, where lower p-norms (like L1 and L2) are preferred due to their balance of computational feasibility and desirable optimization properties. Higher p-norms, while theoretically interesting, often present practical challenges for optimization.\n",
        "\n",
        "*How can you quantify the computational cost?*\n",
        "\n",
        "Quantifying the computational cost of an algorithm or a computational process involves assessing several factors, such as time complexity, space complexity, and the actual execution time and memory usage in practice. Here's a breakdown of how these are typically quantified:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Time Complexity:**\n",
        "   - Time complexity is a theoretical measure of the execution time of an algorithm as a function of the size of the input data. It's usually expressed in Big O notation (like O(n), O(n^2), O(log n)), which describes the upper limit of the growth rate of the runtime.\n",
        "   - This measure helps to understand how the execution time will increase as the input size grows. It's crucial for comparing different algorithms, especially in terms of their scalability.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Space Complexity:**\n",
        "   - Space complexity measures the amount of memory an algorithm needs in terms of the size of the input data. Like time complexity, it's also expressed in Big O notation.\n",
        "   - This aspect is important in scenarios where memory is a limiting factor, such as in embedded systems or when dealing with extremely large data sets.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Actual Execution Time:**\n",
        "   - The actual execution time is the real-time an algorithm takes to complete. This can be measured by running the algorithm and timing its execution.\n",
        "   - The actual execution time can vary based on several factors, including the hardware used, the efficiency of the implementation, and the specific characteristics of the input data.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Actual Memory Usage:**\n",
        "   - This is a practical measurement of the amount of memory used by an algorithm when it runs. It can be measured using profiling tools.\n",
        "   - Actual memory usage can vary from the theoretical space complexity due to factors like the efficiency of the memory allocation in the implementation and overheads imposed by the system or the programming environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Algorithmic Efficiency:**\n",
        "   - Efficiency takes into account both time and space complexity. An efficient algorithm is one that has both a lower time complexity and a lower space complexity.\n",
        "   - In practice, there's often a trade-off between time and space efficiency (known as the time-space trade-off). Optimizing for one can lead to increased usage of the other.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Profiling and Benchmarking:**\n",
        "   - In practice, profiling and benchmarking are used to quantify the computational cost of an algorithm. Profiling involves running the algorithm with specific tools to measure various performance metrics like execution time and memory usage.\n",
        "   - Benchmarking involves comparing these performance metrics under different conditions or against other algorithms to assess relative performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, quantifying computational cost involves a mix of theoretical analysis (time and space complexity) and practical measurements (actual execution time and memory usage). This assessment helps in understanding the efficiency of an algorithm and its suitability for a particular application, especially when resources are limited or when dealing with large-scale problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "*could you quantify the Time Complexity in advance without running the function?*\n",
        "\n",
        "Yes, you can quantify the time complexity of an algorithm in advance without actually running the function. This is typically done through theoretical analysis based on the algorithm's structure and operations. Here's how you might approach this:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Understand the Algorithm's Operations:**\n",
        "   - Analyze each part of the algorithm and identify the basic operations (like comparisons, assignments, arithmetic operations) and how often they are performed relative to the input size.\n",
        "   - Pay special attention to loops and nested loops, as they often play a significant role in determining time complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Counting Basic Operations:**\n",
        "   - For each line of code or each operation, estimate how many times it will be executed in terms of the size of the input. For instance, a single loop from 1 to \\( n \\) suggests \\( n \\) iterations, while a nested loop might suggest \\( n^2 \\) iterations.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Big O Notation:**\n",
        "   - Express the total number of basic operations in Big O notation. This involves finding the term with the fastest-growing rate and ignoring constants and less significant terms. For example, if the total operations are \\( 5n^2 + 3n + 8 \\), the time complexity is \\( O(n^2) \\).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Consider the Worst, Average, and Best Cases:**\n",
        "   - Analyze the time complexity for different scenarios: worst-case (upper bound), average case (expected complexity for a random input), and best case (lower bound). Sometimes, the complexity might be the same for all cases, but often it varies.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Comparing Different Parts of the Algorithm:**\n",
        "   - If the algorithm has different components or phases, analyze each part separately and then combine the results. The overall complexity is dominated by the part with the highest complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Recursion:**\n",
        "   - For recursive algorithms, establish the recurrence relation describing the algorithm and solve it to find the time complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Amortized Analysis:**\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Using the Normal Equation:**\n",
        "   - The normal equation for Ridge Regression is \\((X^TX + \\lambda I)^{-1}X^Ty\\), where \\( X \\) is the feature matrix, \\( y \\) is the target vector, \\( \\lambda \\) is the regularization parameter, and \\( I \\) is the identity matrix.\n",
        "   - The computationally intensive step here is the matrix multiplication \\( X^TX \\) and the matrix inversion \\((X^TX + \\lambda I)^{-1}\\).\n",
        "   - The multiplication \\( X^TX \\) has a complexity of \\( O(m^2n) \\), as it involves multiplying an \\( n \\times m \\) matrix with its transpose \\( m \\times n \\).\n",
        "   - Matrix inversion typically has a complexity of \\( O(m^3) \\) using standard algorithms like Gaussian elimination.\n",
        "   - So, the overall complexity would be dominated by the higher of \\( O(m^2n) \\) and \\( O(m^3) \\).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Using Gradient Descent:**\n",
        "   - If Ridge Regression is solved using gradient descent, the time complexity per iteration is \\( O(mn) \\), since each update requires computing gradients over all \\( n \\) samples and \\( m \\) features.\n",
        "   - However, the total number of iterations needed to converge can vary widely depending on the learning rate and the specifics of the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, the time complexity of linear regression using the L2 norm is not simply \\( n^2 \\); it depends on the method used for solving the regression and the relationship between the number of features \\( m \\) and the number of samples \\( n \\). For the normal equation method, it's generally the higher of \\( O(m^2n) \\) and \\( O(m^3) \\), while for gradient descent, it's \\( O(mn) \\) per iteration."

Sequential logic has state (memory). Sequential logic is used to store the state of the automaton, which is necessary to track the current position of the tape head and the symbols that have been read (more complex, because requires a larger number of memory elements, and the logic to update the state of the automaton can be more complicated). The sequential logic is implemented using flip-flops, which are memory elements that can store a single bit of information. [Combinational Logic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinational_logic): output is a function of only the present input. Combinational logic does not have a state (memory). Combinatorial logic is used to determine the next state of the automaton and the output symbol to be written to the tape, based on the current state, the input symbol, and the contents of the tape. Combinational logic is used in computer circuits to perform Boolean algebra on input signals and on stored data. The ALU is constructed using combinational logic, also half adders, full adders, half subtractors, full subtractors, multiplexers, demultiplexers, encoders and decoders, AND, OR, and NOT. The combinational logic is typically much simpler than the sequential logic. This is because the next state of the automaton and the output symbol to be written to the tape can be determined by a relatively small number of input variables.*\n",

In this talk, I'll review this result and then give a new extension to the setting of computability theory.  Namely, I'll show that a classical or quantum computer with access to a Deutschian CTC (with no bound on its size) could solve exactly the problems that are Turing-reducible to the halting problem.  Just like in the complexity setting, the most technically interesting part is the upper bound on the power of quantum computers with access to a Deutschian CTC.\n"

        "\n",
        "The phrase \"Black holes are the fastest scramblers in Nature\" refers to a concept in theoretical physics that describes how black holes process information. In this context, \"scrambling\" refers to the way in which information that enters a black hole gets mixed up or dispersed throughout the black hole's horizon.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are the key points to understand this concept:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Information Theory and Black Holes**: In the realm of physics, especially quantum mechanics and general relativity, information is a fundamental concept. It's often considered in terms of quantum information, which deals with the quantum states of particles.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Scrambling in Black Holes**: When information falls into a black hole, it doesn't get destroyed (as per the principle of quantum information conservation). Instead, it gets scrambled. This means the information is spread out across the event horizon of the black hole in a highly mixed state. It's like shuffling a deck of cards so thoroughly that the original order is completely lost.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Fastest Scramblers**: The assertion that black holes are the fastest scramblers suggests that they are extremely efficient at this process. This idea comes from the holographic principle in string theory, where the time it takes for information to scramble in a black hole is related to its size. The larger the black hole, the faster it scrambles information.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Implications for Quantum Physics and Gravity**: This concept is important in the study of quantum gravity and the information paradox. It suggests a deep connection between gravity (black holes) and quantum mechanics (information theory).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Chaos Theory and Black Holes**: The scrambling effect is also associated with chaos theory in physics, where small changes in initial conditions can lead to vastly different outcomes. In a black hole, the scrambling of information is an ultimate form of chaotic behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "This idea is a topic of ongoing research and debate in theoretical physics, particularly in the context of understanding the fundamental nature of black holes, quantum mechanics, and the fabric of spacetime."

        "**is it possible to recover the information, that is spread out across the event horizon of the black hole in a highly mixed state?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The question of whether information that has been spread out across the event horizon of a black hole can be recovered is a major topic in theoretical physics, particularly in the context of the black hole information paradox. This paradox arises from the clash between quantum mechanics, which says information cannot be destroyed, and general relativity, which suggests that information falling into a black hole is lost forever.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are some key points in this discussion:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Hawking Radiation and Information Loss**: Stephen Hawking initially proposed that black holes emit radiation (now known as Hawking radiation) and can eventually evaporate completely. This led to the paradox: if the black hole disappears, what happens to the information that fell into it? Hawking initially argued that this information is lost forever, which contradicts the principles of quantum mechanics.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Information Scrambling vs. Destruction**: While black holes are believed to scramble information almost beyond recognition, scrambling is not the same as destruction. Theoretical work, particularly in the context of the holographic principle and string theory, suggests that while information is highly scrambled, it is not necessarily destroyed.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **AdS/CFT Correspondence**: A concept from string theory called the Anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence provides a framework where the physics inside a black hole (including the fate of information) might be understood in terms of a lower-dimensional boundary, like the event horizon. This has led some physicists to propose that information is somehow encoded on the horizon and could, in principle, be recovered.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Black Hole Complementarity**: Another proposed solution is the concept of black hole complementarity, which suggests that information is both reflected at the event horizon and passes through, but no observer can confirm both realities simultaneously. This tries to reconcile the information loss with quantum mechanics without requiring information to actually be duplicated.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Firewall Hypothesis**: Some researchers have suggested the existence of a \"firewall\" at the event horizon, which would destroy any information. This hypothesis aims to resolve the paradox but is controversial and contradicts the idea that crossing a black hole's event horizon is uneventful (as predicted by general relativity).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Recent Developments**: Recent theoretical developments, including the use of quantum error correction in the context of the holographic principle, suggest that information may indeed be recoverable in principle, although the exact mechanism remains unclear.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, while it's theoretically possible that information spread out across a black hole's event horizon might be recoverable, this remains a topic of active research and debate in the fields of quantum mechanics, quantum gravity, and cosmology. The true nature of information processing by black holes continues to be one of the most intriguing puzzles in modern theoretical physics."

        "\"According to the AdS/CFT correspondence, the geometries of certain spacetimes are fully determined by quantum states that live on their boundaries-indeed, by the von Neumann entropies of portions of those boundary states. This work investigates to what extent the geometries can be reconstructed from the entropies in polynomial time. Bouland, Fefferman, and Vazirani (2019) argued that the AdS/CFT map can be exponentially complex if one wants to reconstruct regions such as the interiors of black holes. Our main result provides a sort of converse: we show that, in the special case of a single 1D boundary, if the input data consists of a list of entropies of contiguous boundary regions, and if the entropies satisfy a single inequality called Strong Subadditivity, then we can construct a graph model for the bulk in linear time. Moreover, the bulk graph is planar, it has O(N?) vertices (the information-theoretic minimum), and it's \"universal,\" with only the edge weights depending on the specific entropies in question. From a combinatorial perspective, our problem boils down to an \"inverse\" of the famous min-cut problem: rather than being given a graph and asked to find a min-cut, here we're given the values of min-cuts separating various sets of vertices, and need to find a weighted undirected graph consistent with those values. Our solution to this problem relies on the notion of a \"bulkless\" graph, which might be of independent interest for AdS/CFT. We also make initial progress on the case of multiple 1D boundaries-where the boundaries could be connected via wormholes- including an upper bound of O (N4) vertices whenever an embeddable bulk graph exists (thus putting the problem into the complexity class\n",
