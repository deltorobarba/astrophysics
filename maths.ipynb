        "Quantum computers are much more susceptible to errors than classical computers due to decoherence and noise. The threshold theorem states that a noisy quantum computer can use quantum error-correcting codes to simulate a noiseless quantum computer assuming the error introduced in each computer cycle is less than some number. Numerical simulations suggest that that number may be as high as 3%. However, it is not yet definitively known how the resources needed for error correction will scale with the number of qubits. Skeptics point to the unknown behavior of noise in scaled-up quantum systems as a potential roadblock for successfully implementing quantum computing and demonstrating quantum supremacy."

        "Linear maps are in some sense more general than matrices. They are also different (types of) objects, even though matrices can be used to represent _some_ linear maps. The matrix representation of a particular linear map depends on the choice of basis of the domain and target space, for example, whereas the linear map itself is invariant under such choices. On the other hand a matrix can also represent a bilinear form, not just a linear map. Consider reading Axler's _Linear Algebra Done Right_ for a good explanation of some of such subtleties. \n",
