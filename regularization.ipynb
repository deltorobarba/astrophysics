        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "* Regularization is a technique for preventing over-fitting by penalizing a model for having large weights\n",
        "* \"Overfitting is when you have a complicated model that gives worse predictions, on average, than a simpler model\" (Andrew Gelman). \"Overfitting of models is widely recognized as a concern. It is less recognized however that overfitting is not an absolute but involves a comparison. A model overfits if it is more complex than another model that fits equally well\" (Douglas Hawkins).\n",
        "* Weight regularization was borrowed from penalized regression models in statistics. Neural networks learn a set of weights that best map inputs to outputs. A network with large network weights can be a sign of an unstable network where small changes in the input can lead to large changes in the output. This can be a sign that the network has overfit the training dataset and will likely perform poorly when making predictions on new data. A solution to this problem is to update the learning algorithm to encourage the network to keep the weights small. This is called weight regularization and it can be used as a general technique to reduce overfitting of the training dataset and improve the generalization of the model.\n",
        "* **Measures against overfitting**: Vectornorm (L1, L2, Elastic Net), Dropout, Jitter, batch size, ensemble models, simpler model, more data..\n",
        "\n",
        "<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "**Benefits of regularization from a mathematical optimization point of view**\n",
        "* Almost every machine learning model can be cast as an optimization problem: (linear regression, logistic regression, SVMs, neural networks, PCA, ICA, K-means), where we form a cost function and try to minimize it in order to find optimal values for our model's parameters. Some machine learning models have cost functions that are non-convex, e.g., neural networks. From an optimization perspective, this is an undesirable property. Stationary points in these two cost functions are problematic because numerical optimization schemes (like gradient descent) can easily get stuck in them, leading to poor results.\n",
        "* Regularization can be used as a way of convexifying a non-convex cost function to help gradient descent avoid some undesirable stationary points of such a function. The L2 regularizer, being an upward-facing convex function, can unflatten flat regions and curve up some stationary points without severely changing the minimum locations (e.g L2 regularized cost no longer has an issue with saddle points, as the region surrounding it has been curved upwards). \n",
        "* Furthermore, regularization can also help with the optimization of convex machine learning problems, when is not invertible. One can easily verify that the solution to the L2 regularized version of linear regression is given by is the regularization parameter, which can be set large enough so that becomes invertible. Why regularize with the L1 norm? To answer this question let's keep our optimization glasses on for a little longer. The L0 norm (not really a norm!) of a vector w, usually denoted by ‖w‖, is the number of nonzero entries in w So if you want to make w sparse (for the reasons we get to later), a direct way to do so is by minimizing ‖w‖. Unfortunately, in many cases this is not an easy task, so instead we replace it with the best convex approximation to it, which is (you guessed it right!) the L1 norm. So you can think of the L1 norm as a compromise between the L0 and L2 norms, inheriting the sparsity-inducing property from the former and convexity from the latter.\n",

        "**Overfitting or Overtraining?**\n",
        "* From [Mehmet Suzen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mehmetsuzen/): All due respect to [Andrew Ng](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyG-7nRpsW8) but regularisation does not prevent overfitting or even reduces. Regularisation originally developed for reducing ill-conditioning in inverse-problems. Regularisation, along with early-stopping, cross-validation and drop out, reduces and provides a reliable measure for generalisation error. Overfitting, on the other hand, is about the 'fit' , i.e., the model complexity. In deep nets, model complexity correlates with the full architecture and the activation functions. Of course, this sounds like a semantic issue for many but this was how it was called in 90s, 'overtraining' (([IEEE: Asymptotic statistical theory of overtraining and cross-validation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/623200)).\n",
        "* Answer: if let it be, the learning process \"will tend to learn more and more complex functions as the number of iterations increases\". A model represented by a more complex function, thus having poor generalization, is an overfitting model. From the statement above, such a model can be prevented by stopping the learning early (among other techniques). Regularization is a process of applying those techniques. \n"
