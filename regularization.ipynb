        "* [Mehmet Suzen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mehmetsuzen/): Regularisation does not prevent overfitting or even reduces. Regularisation originally developed for reducing ill-conditioning in inverse-problems. Regularisation, along with early-stopping, cross-validation and drop out, reduces and provides a reliable measure for generalisation error. Overfitting, on the other hand, is about the 'fit' , i.e., the model complexity. In deep nets, model complexity correlates with the full architecture and the activation functions. This is called 'overtraining' ([IEEE](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/623200)).\n",
        "* Answer: if let it be, the learning process \"will tend to learn more and more complex functions as the number of iterations increases\". A model represented by a more complex function, thus having poor generalization, is an overfitting model. From the statement above, such a model can be prevented by stopping the learning early (among other techniques). Regularization is a process of applying those techniques. "
