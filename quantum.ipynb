        "\\textbf{Hilbert spaces} are a crucial mathematical concept in quantum mechanics, providing the framework to describe systems with infinitely-many possible states and the operations performed upon them. Hilbert spaces allow for the description of quantum systems that can exist in superpositions, which often involve infinitely many possible states, unlike classical systems with their finitely-limited possibilities. Importantly, Hilbert spaces possess properties crucial for quantum mechanics: inner products allow us to calculate the probability of finding a system in a particular state, as well as expectation values of observables (like position or momentum). Completeness ensures that any valid quantum state can be represented within the Hilbert space and described by its mathematical framework. With these properties, Hilbert spaces provide the mathematical foundation to rigorously model quantum states and their evolution.\n",

        "\\textbf{Quantum states} encapsulate all the physically measurable information about a quantum system and probabilities related to its potential measurement outcomes. One way to describe a quantum state is the \\textbf{wave function}, symbolized by the Greek letter $\\psi$. It's a complex-valued function that encapsulates all conceivable information about a quantum system. This information is probabilistic rather than deterministic, marking a departure from classical mechanics by not specifying exact positions or momenta. Instead, it offers the probability densities for locating a particle in various positions or states of motion, with the square of the wavefunction's magnitude ($|\\psi|^2$) representing the likelihood of finding the particle at a specific point in space and time.\n",

        "Wavefunctions embody the principle of superposition, blending all potential states a system might inhabit. Through this, it communicates possible quantum states, observables (like position, momentum, and energy), and how these states evolve over time. To glean insights on observables, one applies corresponding mathematical operators to the wavefunction. Its temporal evolution is dictated by the Schrödinger equation, enabling predictions about the system's future behavior. However, the wavefunction itself isn't directly observable; we only infer its characteristics through the probability outcomes of measurements. In numerous quantum interpretations, the act of measurement forces the wavefunction to \"collapse,\" narrowing the system down to a single possible state from the many it potentially occupied. This aspect of quantum mechanics, central yet subject to diverse interpretations, underscores the stark contrast between quantum and classical physics in conceptualizing reality.\n",

Kets are elements of a complex vector space called a Hilbert space, and they mathematically represent the system's wave function $\\Psi$. A ket state is a vector whose elements represent the probability amplitudes associated with a quantum system's possible states. For example, a qubit in a superposition of its two basis states $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ can be represented by a general ket state $|\\psi\\rangle = \\alpha |0\\rangle + \\beta |1\\rangle$, where $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are complex numbers representing probability amplitudes that satisfy the normalization condition: $|\\alpha|^2$ +  $|\\beta|^2$ = 1.

Specifically, Holevo's bound states that the maximum amount of classical information accessible from a single qubit is one bit, even if the qubit was initially prepared in a complex superposition \\cite{621.391.1:535.14}. This emphasizes the difference between the potential information encoded within a quantum system and the information we can practically extract through classical measurements.\n",

        "\"There are (at least) two possible ways to formulate precisely (i.e. mathematically) elementary\n",
        "QM. The eldest one, historically speaking, is due to von Neumann in essence, and is formulated using the language of Hilbert spaces and the spectral theory of unbounded operators. A more recent and mature formulation was developed by several authors in the attempt to solve quantum field theory problems in mathematical physics. It relies on the theory of abstract algebras (*-algebras and C* -algebras) that are built mimicking the operator algebras defined and studied, again, by von Neumann (nowadays known as W* -algebras or von Neumann algebras), but freed from the Hilbert-space structure. The core result is the celebrated GNS theorem (after Gelfand, Najmark and Segal), that we will prove in Chap. 14. The newer formulation can be considered an extension of the former one, in a very precise sense that we shall not go into here, also by virtue of the novel physical context it introduces and by the possibility of treating physical systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom, i.e. quantum fields. In particular, this second formulation makes precise sense of the demand for locality and covariance of relativistic quantum field theories, and allows to extend quantum field theories to a curved spacetime.\"\n",

U(1) is a mathematical group that represents a continuous symmetry associated with global phase transformations. We can outline how quantum field theory incorporates this symmetry to explain the concept:\n",

        "✅ Global U(1) Phase Symmetry:\n",
        "In quantum field theory, we work with fields and operators that are often complex-valued. The global U(1) phase symmetry refers to the ability to multiply the entire quantum state by a complex phase factor without affecting the physical observables. Mathematically, for a one-qubit system, the global U(1) phase transformation can be represented as follows:\n",

        "\n",
        "✅ No Observable Impact: The key feature of this global phase transformation is that it does not change the probabilities of measurement outcomes or any other physically observable quantities. The global phase is, in a sense, \"gauged out\" because it affects both the quantum state and its complex conjugate, so it cancels out in terms of probabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Conservation of Probability: The conservation of probability is ensured by the U(1) phase symmetry. The probabilities of measuring a qubit in any state remain constant under global phase transformations. This property is closely related to the conservation of probability in quantum systems.\n",

        "✅ Interference and Relative Phases: While the global phase itself is not physically meaningful, relative phases between different quantum states are significant. Quantum field theory allows for interference effects, which arise from relative phases between states. This interference is crucial in understanding phenomena like quantum entanglement and quantum superposition.\n",

        "Der Schlüssel zu voll funktionsfähigen Quantencomputern ist Magie. Damit sind keine mysteriösen Glaskugeln oder übernatürliche Kräfte gemeint. Vielmehr bezeichnen Physiker so jene Quantenberechnungen, die sich nicht mit gewöhnlichen Rechnern durchführen lassen. Allerdings sind solche »magischen Zustände« sehr aufwändig herzustellen. Wie ein Forschungsteam um den Physiker Pradeep Niroula von der University of Maryland nun in der Fachzeitschrift »Nature Physics« berichtet, können Fehler in bestimmten Qubit-Anordnungen magische Zustände erzeugen. Tatsächlich beobachteten die Forschenden eine Art Phasenübergang: Die Stärke der Fehler übernimmt dabei die Rolle der Temperatur und führt zu einem Übergang von »nichtmagischen« zu magischen Zuständen, die teilweise mit negativen Wahrscheinlichkeiten behaftet sind. »Die Quanteninformatik schreitet weiter voran und das Verständnis und die Nutzung der Magie wird der Schlüssel sein, um das volle Potenzial der Quantentechnologien zu erschließen«, schreibt der Physiker Xhek Turkeshi von der Universität zu Köln in einem bei »Nature« erschienenen Begleitartikel zur Forschungsarbeit.\n",

        "Neue Wirkstoffe, Wundermaterialien und ein tieferes Verständnis der Quantenwelt: Das sind nur einige der beeindruckenden Versprechungen von Quantencomputern. Im Gegensatz zu herkömmlichen Rechnern verarbeiten Quantencomputer quantenmechanische Informationseinheiten, so genannte Qubits. Diese können wie ihre klassischen Pendants die Werte eins und null annehmen – aber auch überlagerte Zustände aufweisen, bei denen sie beispielsweise mit 60-prozentiger Wahrscheinlichkeit null und mit 40-prozentiger eins sind. Zudem können Qubits durch eine Art unsichtbares Band selbst über große Distanzen hinweg untrennbar miteinander verbunden sein; ein Quantenphänomen, das als Verschränkung bekannt ist. Die seltsamen Regeln der Quantenmechanik ermöglichen es, völlig neue Arten von Berechnungen durchzuführen – und so einige Probleme zu lösen, die für gewöhnliche Rechner unerreichbar sind.\n",
        "\n",
        "**»Oft wird behauptet, das Besondere an Quantencomputern seien die Überlagerung und die Verschränkung, aber das stimmt so nicht ganz«, schrieb die Physikerin Zaira Nazario vom IBM Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York, in einem »Spektrum«-Artikel. Tatsächlich können viele Quantenberechnungen effizient durch klassische Computer simuliert werden. Hierbei unterscheiden Quanteninformationstheoretiker zwei Arten von Qubit-Operationen: so genannte Clifford-Gatter und Nicht-Clifford-Gatter. Beide können die Quanteninformationseinheiten überlagern oder miteinander verschränken. Erstere sind einfacher umzusetzen – mit ihnen lassen sich aber nur Berechnungen durchführen, die auch klassische Computer bewältigen können. Damit bieten sie keinen Vorteil. »Für sich genommen können sie keinen universellen Quantencomputer bilden, da sie nicht alle möglichen Quantenzustände erzeugen können«, schreibt Xhek Turkeshi.**\n",
        "\n",
        "Tatsächlich können Quantencomputer ihre gesamte Kraft erst entfalten, wenn sie Nicht-Clifford-Gatter enthalten. Diese entsprechen jenen Operationen, die nicht effizient durch gewöhnliche Rechner simuliert werden können; etwa die Vertauschung zweier Qubits oder die Änderung der Phase um π/4. Die berühmtesten Quantenalgorithmen wie der Shor-Algorithmus (der es Quantencomputern ermöglichen könnte, große Zahlen schnell in ihre Primteiler zu zerlegen) greifen in der Regel immer auf solche Operationen zurück. »In Quantencomputern lassen sich Nicht-Clifford-Gatter einfach umsetzen«, schreiben die Forschenden um Pradeep Niroula in ihrer Arbeit. Die Situation sieht allerdings anders aus, wenn man Quantenfehlerkorrekturen miteinbezieht.\n",

        "Quantencomputer haben einen entscheidenden Nachteil: Sie sind extrem empfindlich. Kleinste Umwelteinflüsse wie Erschütterungen oder Temperaturschwankungen können die Quantenzustände der Qubits zerstören und Fehler erzeugen. Daher sind Algorithmen zur Fehlerkorrektur für verlässliche Berechnungen unverzichtbar. Dabei verteilt man die Quanteninformation auf mehrere »physische« Qubits (zum Beispiel die Ionen oder die supraleitenden Schaltkreise, je nach Art des Quantencomputers) und codiert damit ein einzelnes »logisches« Qubit. Solche Algorithmen erhöhen also die Anzahl der benötigten Quanteninformationseinheiten.\n",
        "\n",
        "Clifford-Gatter lassen sich mit Quantenfehlerkorrekturen einfach verbinden: Diese Gatter verarbeiten die vielen physischen Qubits, aus denen ein einzelnes logisches Qubits besteht, individuell. »Daher bleibt die Fehlerrate immer gleich und somit unter Kontrolle«, schrieb Zaira Nazario. »Das ist eine nützliche Eigenschaft, die verhindert, dass sich große Rechnungen nicht mehr bewältigen lassen.« Anders ist es hingegen bei Nicht-Clifford-Gattern. Wenn Fehler auftreten, lassen sich diese Gatter viel schwieriger korrigieren; sie sind so empfindlich, dass schon der kleinste Fehler bei diesen Operationen eine ganze Berechnung zunichtemachen kann. Doch Physikerinnen und Physiker haben einen Ausweg gefunden: Magie.\n",
        "\n",
        "»Die komplizierten Nicht-Clifford-Gatter werden dabei durch Qubits ersetzt, die sich in einem magischen Zustand befinden«, schrieb Nazario. »Diese codieren dann die Wirkung der Nicht-Clifford-Operationen.« Indem man also solche magischen Zustände mit Clifford-Gattern verbindet, lassen sich theoretisch fehlertolerante Quantencomputer realisieren. Theoretisch. Denn die magischen Zustände reagieren nicht nur extrem empfindlich auf äußere Einflüsse, sondern sind auch in der Herstellung sehr aufwändig. In der Regel muss man sehr viele fehlerbehaftete magische Zustände herstellen und dann daraus die »reinsten« extrahieren.\n",
        "\n",
        "»Das Verständnis der Mechanismen, durch die Magie erzeugt oder zerstört wird, ist ein wichtiger Schritt auf dem Weg zu einer effizienten und praktischen fehlertoleranten Berechnung«, schreibt das Team um Niroula. Deshalb haben sie das Phänomen genauer unter die Lupe genommen. Die Fachleute griffen dafür nicht nur auf computergestützte Simulationen zurück, sondern setzten ihre Überlegungen auch in einem 32 Qubits umfassenden Quantencomputer mit Ionenfallen um.\n",
        "\n",

In spectral graph theory applications, such as spectral clustering, QPE can be used to find the eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian, significantly speeding up the clustering process based on spectral properties. Principal component analysis, a method for dimensionality reduction, involves solving eigenvalue problems, which can also be accelerated using QPE. The classical complexity of these problems is around 𝑂(𝑁2), while the quantum complexity can be reduced to 𝑂(log2⁡(𝑁)), providing an exponential advantage.\n",

For instance, the overall complexity of the quantum algorithm might still scale poorly with the size of the problem.\n",

This lower bound matches the known upper bound, indicating that we have a good understanding of the optimal query complexity for QPE.  This lower bound means that there is a fundamental limit to how quickly QPE can converge to the true phase value, which is crucial for resource-constrained scenarios.\n",

In many cases however, we want to solve problems with an inherent mathematical structure, like multiplication of matrices. In algebraic complexity theory, we only look at very special classes of algorithms, those which have algebraic descriptions and interpretations. This way, stronger mathematical tools can be employed to answer computational questions. We give a short introduction to some of these algebraic models.\n",

Sequential logic has state (memory). Sequential logic is used to store the state of the automaton, which is necessary to track the current position of the tape head and the symbols that have been read (more complex, because requires a larger number of memory elements, and the logic to update the state of the automaton can be more complicated). The sequential logic is implemented using flip-flops, which are memory elements that can store a single bit of information. [Combinational Logic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinational_logic): output is a function of only the present input. Combinational logic does not have a state (memory). Combinatorial logic is used to determine the next state of the automaton and the output symbol to be written to the tape, based on the current state, the input symbol, and the contents of the tape. Combinational logic is used in computer circuits to perform Boolean algebra on input signals and on stored data. The ALU is constructed using combinational logic, also half adders, full adders, half subtractors, full subtractors, multiplexers, demultiplexers, encoders and decoders, AND, OR, and NOT. The combinational logic is typically much simpler than the sequential logic. This is because the next state of the automaton and the output symbol to be written to the tape can be determined by a relatively small number of input variables.*\n",

Why? Moore and Mead figured it out at Fairchild in 1968. Smaller transistors are faster, cheaper, and use less power! Ever since then semiconductor manufacturers have been racing to see who can make the fastest, smallest, lowest power, highest performance transistors. - Apple’s iPhone XS uses 7 nanometer transistors. So let’s estimate how many atoms are in one of them. Excluding the connecting wires and other parts, I’m just going to calculate the size of the active part, the “channel” under the gate. The volume of the channel is about (7 nm long) x (7 nm deep) x (20 nm wide). The atomic density of silicon is 5E+28 atoms per cubic meter. Number of atoms n = volume x density = n = (980E-27) x (5E+28) = 49,000 atoms. [Source](https://www.quora.com/How-many-atoms-are-in-a-typical-transistor-in-a-chip#)\n"

In this work, we construct examples of constant description length but exponential circuit complexity. We provide infinite families such that each element requires an exponential number of two-qubit gates to be generated exactly from a product and where the same is true for the approximate generation of the vast majority of elements in the family. The results are based on sets of large transcendence degree and discussed for tensor networks, diagonal unitaries, and maximally coherent states.\n",

        "* Jens Eisert: Fundamental limits to quantum computation: Quantum computers promise superior computational power over classical computers for some structured problems. While this insight is not new, only in recent years, steps have been taken to actually build intermediate-sized quantum devices, creating an exciting state of affairs. For some paradigmatic problems, there is some evidence that quantum computers may outperform classical devices [1]. For practically motivated problems in machine learning [2, 3] and in optimization [4], fault tolerant quantum computers indeed perform better than classical ones. While this may be promising, actual systems to date are relatively small and noisy. The main part of the talk is concerned with identifying *limitations* to quantum computing in this realm. We discuss notions of learnability of output distributions of short quantum circuits - as they can be seen as parts of variational quantum algorithms - and find that a single T-gate renders learning them hard [5]. We identify exponentially tighter bounds on limitations of quantum error mitigation [6]. We finally discuss the impact of non-unital noise on quantum computing, with quite unexpected results [7]. We end on the note that while fault tolerant quantum computers offer substantial computational benefits, the race is still open for near-term quantum devices.

Scott aaronson: doing the soap experiment: you need to repeat the trial several times, it does not always find the best solution. it seems to find a local optimum mostly. Prions in protein: local optima! Scott Aaronson: [Black Holes, Firewalls, and the Limits of Quantum Computers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cstKRACrMQY&t=2446). And it cannot scale to large number of nails. **In the case of soap bubbles, nature just seems to apply a really fast approximation which is accurate for small cases but breaks down at larger instances** (due to actual physical properties... i.e. it is physically impossible to build arbitrarily thin rods to dip into soapy water.) Many other NP-problems can be modeled as physical systems in which a lowest-energy-state would correspond to a solution to the combinatorial problem. You can find that \"DNA computing\" solves the clique problem, for instance. [Source](https://groups.google.com/g/comp.theory/c/11lY926-P7M?pli=1)\n",

Dazu haben die Fachleute jeweils »notwendige Bedingungen« aus den Theorien extrahiert, die ein System besitzen müsste, um ein Bewusstsein zu besitzen. Je mehr dieser notwendigen Anforderungen ein System erfülle, so die Argumentation, desto wahrscheinlicher sei es bewusst.\n",
