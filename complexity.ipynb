Importantly, they are connected to the idea of fault-tolerance thresholds – limits on error rates below which quantum computation can be made reliable.\n",

        "\n",
        "* **Fundamental Building Blocks:** The Pauli operators (X, Y, Z) together with the identity operator (I) form a basis for the space of operators on a single qubit.  This means any operation on a single qubit can be expressed as a combination of Paulis.\n",
        "* **Error Representation:** Many common quantum errors can be represented as combinations of Pauli operators acting on qubits. This makes them convenient for describing noise processes\n",
        "* **Qubit Control:**  Pauli operators are used as quantum gates to manipulate the state of qubits, forming the essential toolkit for quantum computation.\n",

        "\n",
        "**What is Low-Degree Truncation?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Low-degree truncation is a technique used in quantum computing to simplify calculations involving complex quantum systems. It involves approximating a system's Hamiltonian (the operator that describes its energy) by keeping only the terms with low-degree polynomials.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How It Works**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Hamiltonian Representation:**  The Hamiltonian of a quantum system can often be expressed as a sum of terms involving products of Pauli operators (X, Y, Z).  Each term has a degree determined by the number of Pauli operators in the product (e.g., the term XY has degree 2).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Truncation:** In low-degree truncation, you keep only the terms in the Hamiltonian up to a certain degree and discard the higher-degree terms. This simplifies the representation and makes calculations more manageable.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why Use Low-Degree Truncation**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Computational Complexity:** Simulating complex quantum systems on classical computers can be extremely computationally expensive. The number of terms in the Hamiltonian grows exponentially with the size of the system. Low-degree truncation reduces this complexity.\n",
        "* **Focus on Essential Interactions:** In many systems, the essential physics is often captured by the low-order interactions. Truncating higher-order terms may introduce some error but often provides a good approximation while significantly simplifying the calculations.\n",
        "* **Resource Limitations:** Quantum computers themselves have a limited number of qubits and limited gate depth they can apply. Low-degree truncation can make problems more amenable to simulation on near-term quantum devices.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Applications**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Quantum Chemistry Simulations:** Low-degree truncation is used in simulating the electronic structure of molecules. This helps understand chemical reactions and design new materials.\n",
        "* **Material Science:**  It's used in simulations of materials to predict their properties, aiding in the discovery of new materials with tailored characteristics.\n",
        "* **Quantum Optimization:**  Some quantum optimization algorithms are amenable to low-degree truncation, making it possible to approximate solutions to complex optimization problems.\n",

        "Low-degree truncation is a powerful tool for making quantum simulations more tractable, especially when dealing with large or complex systems. However, there's a trade-off:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Accuracy vs. Efficiency:**  Truncation introduces errors, so it's important to balance accuracy requirements with computational efficiency when choosing the degree of truncation.\n",

        "\n",
        "Consider a Hamiltonian with terms like X, Y, Z, XY, XZ, YZ, XYZ.  A low-degree truncation at degree 2 would only keep the terms X, Y, Z, XY, XZ, and YZ, and discard the XYZ term.\n",

The Weyl chamber is then defined as the set of all vectors in three-dimensional space whose canonical coordinates satisfy certain constraints.\n",
        "\n",
        "The vertices of the Weyl chamber correspond to the following four types of gates:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Identity:** The identity gate, which does not change the state of the two qubits.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **CNOT:** The controlled-NOT gate, which flips the state of the target qubit if and only if the control qubit is in the state 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Swap:** The swap gate, which exchanges the states of the two qubits.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **√Swap:** The square root of the swap gate, which is a gate that is halfway between the identity and the swap gate.\n",
        "\n",
        "The interior of the Weyl chamber consists of a much larger number of gates, including all of the other possible two-qubit gates that can be constructed from the Pauli matrices. These gates can be classified by their entanglement properties, their ability to generate certain types of states, and their performance in quantum algorithms.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Weyl chamber is a useful tool for understanding the structure of two-qubit quantum gates. It allows us to visualize the relationships between different gates, and to identify important classes of gates. The Weyl chamber can also be used to design new gates and algorithms.\n",

When X-rays encounter a boundary between two materials with different refractive indices, they undergo a phase shift. This phase shift contains valuable information about the object's internal structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "To perform shadow tomography, a coherent X-ray source, such as a synchrotron or an X-ray tube, is used. The X-rays pass through the object and are collected by a detector placed behind it. The collected X-rays contain both intensity and phase information.\n",
        "\n",
        "The key to shadow tomography lies in extracting the phase information from the intensity measurements. This is typically achieved by using specialized techniques such as interferometry or grating-based methods. These methods create interference patterns that encode the phase information, which can then be computationally reconstructed into a three-dimensional image.\n",
        "\n",
        "The resulting shadow tomography image provides not only information about the X-ray absorption but also about the object's refractive index distribution and other structural features. This enables visualization of fine details, such as boundaries between tissues or subtle density variations, which may not be easily distinguishable in traditional X-ray images.\n",
        "\n",
        "Shadow tomography has the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and enhance our understanding of complex biological and materials systems. However, it currently requires advanced X-ray sources and specialized techniques, limiting its widespread availability in clinical settings. Nevertheless, ongoing research and technological advancements aim to make shadow tomography more accessible and applicable in various fields."

In essence, it's a method used to figure out the unknown quantum state of a system. It's called \"tomography\" because, like a CT scan in medicine, it combines many different measurements to construct a full picture of something you can't directly observe in one shot.\n",
        "\n",
        "For a quantum system, the state is typically represented by a density matrix. In the simplest case, for a single qubit, the density matrix is a 2x2 Hermitian matrix that is positive semi-definite and has trace 1. The generalization to multiple qubits is a matrix that is 2^n x 2^n (where n is the number of qubits), but with the same properties.\n",

        "Quantum state tomography involves making various measurements on many identically-prepared copies of the quantum system and then using the results to reconstruct the density matrix. The measurements you make are usually in different bases. For a single qubit, measurements are often made in the X, Y, and Z bases, which correspond to the Pauli matrices.\n",

While the classical Lanczos method has exponential cost in the system size to represent the Krylov states for quantum systems, our efficient quantum algorithm achieves this in polynomial time and memory. The construction presented is exact in the sense that the resulting Krylov space is identical to that of the Lanczos method, so the only approximation with respect to the exact method is due to finite sample noise. This is possible because, unlike previous quantum Krylov methods, our algorithm does not require simulating real or imaginary time evolution.

        "QM. The eldest one, historically speaking, is due to von Neumann in essence, and is formulated using the language of Hilbert spaces and the spectral theory of unbounded operators. A more recent and mature formulation was developed by several authors in the attempt to solve quantum field theory problems in mathematical physics. It relies on the theory of abstract algebras (*-algebras and C* -algebras) that are built mimicking the operator algebras defined and studied, again, by von Neumann (nowadays known as W* -algebras or von Neumann algebras), but freed from the Hilbert-space structure. The core result is the celebrated GNS theorem (after Gelfand, Najmark and Segal), that we will prove in Chap. 14. The newer formulation can be considered an extension of the former one, in a very precise sense that we shall not go into here, also by virtue of the novel physical context it introduces and by the possibility of treating physical systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom, i.e. quantum fields. In particular, this second formulation makes precise sense of the demand for locality and covariance of relativistic quantum field theories, and allows to extend quantum field theories to a curved spacetime.\"\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Mixed State**: A mixed state describes a statistical mixture of different quantum states, each with a certain probability. Mathematically, a mixed state is represented by a density matrix, which is a positive-semidefinite Hermitian operator with trace 1. If a system is in a mixed state, it means we have some classical uncertainty about which specific quantum state it's in. For example, a system might be in state |0⟩ with probability 1/2 and in state |1⟩ with probability 1/2. This would correspond to the mixed state represented by the density matrix ρ = 1/2|0⟩⟨0| + 1/2|1⟩⟨1|.\n",

        "2. **Product State**: A product state refers to a state of a composite system that can be written as the tensor product of states of its subsystems. For example, if you have a two-qubit system and the first qubit is in state |0⟩ and the second qubit is in state |1⟩, the overall state of the system is the product state |0⟩⊗|1⟩, often written as |01⟩. A product state implies that there are no correlations between the subsystems, i.e., the subsystems are not entangled. If a state of a composite system cannot be written as a tensor product of states of its subsystems, it's called an entangled state.\n",

        "So, in summary, the difference lies in what each state represents: a mixed state represents classical uncertainty about which pure state a system is in, while a product state represents a separable (i.e., non-entangled) state of a composite system. Notably, these are not mutually exclusive: you can have a mixed state of product states, for example."

        "One \"pathological\" behavior of the momentum operator is that it doesn't have any eigenstates that belong to the Hilbert space. In quantum mechanics, we often want to find eigenstates of operators because these correspond to \"observable\" states of the system with definite values of the associated physical quantity. For the momentum operator, the eigenstates are plane waves, which are not square-integrable and hence do not belong to the Hilbert space.\n",

U(1) is a mathematical group that represents a continuous symmetry associated with global phase transformations. We can outline how quantum field theory incorporates this symmetry to explain the concept:\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Global U(1) Phase Symmetry:\n",
        "In quantum field theory, we work with fields and operators that are often complex-valued. The global U(1) phase symmetry refers to the ability to multiply the entire quantum state by a complex phase factor without affecting the physical observables. Mathematically, for a one-qubit system, the global U(1) phase transformation can be represented as follows:\n",
        "|ψ⟩ → e^(iθ)|ψ⟩ where, θ is a real number representing the phase transformation.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ No Observable Impact: The key feature of this global phase transformation is that it does not change the probabilities of measurement outcomes or any other physically observable quantities. The global phase is, in a sense, \"gauged out\" because it affects both the quantum state and its complex conjugate, so it cancels out in terms of probabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Conservation of Probability: The conservation of probability is ensured by the U(1) phase symmetry. The probabilities of measuring a qubit in any state remain constant under global phase transformations. This property is closely related to the conservation of probability in quantum systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Interference and Relative Phases: While the global phase itself is not physically meaningful, relative phases between different quantum states are significant. Quantum field theory allows for interference effects, which arise from relative phases between states. This interference is crucial in understanding phenomena like quantum entanglement and quantum superposition.\n",
        "\n",
        "✴ In summary, quantum field theory incorporates the global U(1) phase symmetry to explain the concept of global phase in a one-qubit system.

Quantum states are more powerful than labeled examples (from PAC), because they can represent a superposition of multiple inputs and outputs. This means that a quantum example oracle can provide the learner with more information about the function being learned. ***As a result, quantum example oracles can be used to learn functions that are more difficult to learn with classical PAC learners.*** For example, it has been shown that DNF formulas can be learned efficiently with a quantum example oracle, but they are not known to be efficiently learnable with a classical PAC learner.\n",

A constant function is one that always outputs the same value, regardless of its input. A balanced function is one that outputs 1 half of the time and 0 half of the time. The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm works by first creating a superposition of all possible inputs to f. It then applies the oracle to this superposition. If f is constant, then the oracle will not change the superposition. However, if f is balanced, then the oracle will flip the phase of half of the states in the superposition. Finally, the algorithm measures the superposition. If the measurement result is 0, then f is constant. If the measurement result is 1, then f is balanced.\n"

This rule allows the derivative of a quantum circuit output with respect to its parameters to be computed in terms of circuit evaluations. Given a parameterized quantum gate (say, a rotation gate), the derivative of the expectation value of an observable with respect to the parameter can be computed as the difference between the expectation values of the observable for two slightly different values of the parameter. These \"shifted\" parameter values are typically chosen to be a small positive or negative shift from the original parameter value.

This method is efficient in terms of the number of quantum operations required, especially for circuits with many parameters but a single output (as is common in quantum machine learning models). However, it requires the ability to run quantum operations in reverse, as well as the ability to store quantum states, which can be challenging to implement on near-term quantum devices.\n",

This problem is particularly common with activation functions like the sigmoid or hyperbolic tangent, which squish a large input space into a small output range.\n",

If each of these axes is re-scaled to have unit variance, then the Mahalanobis distance corresponds to standard Euclidean distance in the transformed space. The Mahalanobis distance is thus unitless and scale-invariant, and takes into account the correlations of the data set. In statistics, the covariance matrix of the data is sometimes used to define a distance metric called Mahalanobis distance. The Mahalanobis distance does not satisfy the triangle inequality because it can be zero even if the two points are not the same. This can happen if the covariance matrix is singular. It is often used in multivariate anomaly detection, classification, and regression. [Mahalanobis distance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahalanobis_distance) is useful when dealing with variables measured in different scales (so the units of measure become standardized) and also, in order to avoid correlation issues between these variables.\n",

        "The complexity of linear regression with regularization using different p-norms (such as in Ridge regression for \\( p = 2 \\) or Lasso for \\( p = 1 \\)) does indeed vary, but not necessarily in a direct relationship with the value of \\( p \\).\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **L2 Norm (Ridge Regression - \\( p = 2 \\)):**\n",
        "   - Ridge regression adds a regularization term equal to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients (L2 norm) to the loss function. The computational complexity of ridge regression is similar to ordinary linear regression. The solving process involves matrix operations that are computationally intensive (like inversion), but these operations don't significantly increase in complexity with the addition of the L2 term.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **L1 Norm (Lasso Regression - \\( p = 1 \\)):**\n",
        "   - Lasso regression uses the absolute value of the coefficients (L1 norm) as the regularization term. The main computational challenge with Lasso is that the absolute value function is not differentiable at zero, which complicates the optimization process. Specialized algorithms like coordinate descent are used, and the complexity can be higher compared to ridge regression, especially for high-dimensional data. However, this increased complexity is more due to the nature of the L1 norm rather than its size.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Higher p-norms:**\n",
        "   - In practice, norms higher than L2 are rarely used in linear regression. Theoretically, as \\( p \\) increases beyond 2, the optimization problem can become more challenging due to the increasing non-linearity and non-convexity of the norm. This could potentially lead to higher computational complexity, but such cases are not common in standard linear regression problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the increase in computational complexity with different p-norms in linear regression is less about the size of \\( p \\) and more about the mathematical and computational characteristics of the norms themselves. L1 and L2 norms are the most commonly used, with L1 (Lasso) generally posing more computational challenges due to its non-differentiability at zero. Higher p-norms are not standard in linear regression and could potentially introduce more complex optimization challenges.\n",

        "\n",
        "Higher p-norms exhibit increasing non-linearity and non-convexity due to the mathematical properties of the norms themselves. To understand this, let's first define the p-norm for a vector \\( \\mathbf{x} \\) in \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\):\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "As \\( p \\) increases, the behavior of this norm changes:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Increasing Non-Linearity:**\n",
        "   - For \\( p < 1 \\), the p-norm is non-convex. As \\( p \\) approaches 1, the function becomes linear in nature (the L1 norm or Manhattan norm). Beyond \\( p = 1 \\), including the commonly used \\( p = 2 \\) (Euclidean norm), the function is convex but exhibits increasing non-linearity as \\( p \\) increases.\n",
        "   - The non-linearity arises because higher powers increasingly magnify larger components of the vector more than smaller ones. For instance, in the case of \\( p = 2 \\), squaring each component treats all components equally in terms of their sign but not in terms of their magnitude. As \\( p \\) increases further, this effect becomes more pronounced, leading to a function that responds very non-linearly to changes in the input vector.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Non-Convexity for \\( p > 1 \\):**\n",
        "   - For \\( p > 1 \\), the p-norms are always convex. This convexity is a crucial property for many optimization problems, including those in machine learning, as it ensures that any local minimum is also a global minimum.\n",
        "   - However, as \\( p \\) increases, the shape of the function becomes more \"peaky\" or \"sharp\" around the axes. This can be intuitively understood: for very large \\( p \\), the p-norm is heavily influenced by the largest component of the vector, almost ignoring the smaller components. This behavior can lead to a function that, while still convex, has very steep gradients near the axes, making optimization more challenging.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Practical Implications:**\n",
        "   - In optimization problems, such as those in machine learning, these properties have significant implications. Non-linear, sharp functions can lead to optimization challenges, such as difficulty in finding the global minimum due to steep gradients or flat regions.\n",
        "   - Moreover, the computational cost of evaluating higher p-norms can be significant, as it involves raising each component of the vector to a high power and then taking a root, operations that are more computationally intensive than those required for lower p-norms.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the increase in non-linearity and the specific convexity shape of higher p-norms are inherent to their mathematical definition. These properties influence their practical use in fields like machine learning, where lower p-norms (like L1 and L2) are preferred due to their balance of computational feasibility and desirable optimization properties. Higher p-norms, while theoretically interesting, often present practical challenges for optimization.\n",

        "Quantifying the computational cost of an algorithm or a computational process involves assessing several factors, such as time complexity, space complexity, and the actual execution time and memory usage in practice. Here's a breakdown of how these are typically quantified:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Time Complexity:**\n",
        "   - Time complexity is a theoretical measure of the execution time of an algorithm as a function of the size of the input data. It's usually expressed in Big O notation (like O(n), O(n^2), O(log n)), which describes the upper limit of the growth rate of the runtime.\n",
        "   - This measure helps to understand how the execution time will increase as the input size grows. It's crucial for comparing different algorithms, especially in terms of their scalability.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Space Complexity:**\n",
        "   - Space complexity measures the amount of memory an algorithm needs in terms of the size of the input data. Like time complexity, it's also expressed in Big O notation.\n",
        "   - This aspect is important in scenarios where memory is a limiting factor, such as in embedded systems or when dealing with extremely large data sets.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Actual Execution Time:**\n",
        "   - The actual execution time is the real-time an algorithm takes to complete. This can be measured by running the algorithm and timing its execution.\n",
        "   - The actual execution time can vary based on several factors, including the hardware used, the efficiency of the implementation, and the specific characteristics of the input data.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Actual Memory Usage:**\n",
        "   - This is a practical measurement of the amount of memory used by an algorithm when it runs. It can be measured using profiling tools.\n",
        "   - Actual memory usage can vary from the theoretical space complexity due to factors like the efficiency of the memory allocation in the implementation and overheads imposed by the system or the programming environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Algorithmic Efficiency:**\n",
        "   - Efficiency takes into account both time and space complexity. An efficient algorithm is one that has both a lower time complexity and a lower space complexity.\n",
        "   - In practice, there's often a trade-off between time and space efficiency (known as the time-space trade-off). Optimizing for one can lead to increased usage of the other.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Profiling and Benchmarking:**\n",
        "   - In practice, profiling and benchmarking are used to quantify the computational cost of an algorithm. Profiling involves running the algorithm with specific tools to measure various performance metrics like execution time and memory usage.\n",
        "   - Benchmarking involves comparing these performance metrics under different conditions or against other algorithms to assess relative performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, quantifying computational cost involves a mix of theoretical analysis (time and space complexity) and practical measurements (actual execution time and memory usage). This assessment helps in understanding the efficiency of an algorithm and its suitability for a particular application, especially when resources are limited or when dealing with large-scale problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "*could you quantify the Time Complexity in advance without running the function?*\n",
        "\n",
        "Yes, you can quantify the time complexity of an algorithm in advance without actually running the function. This is typically done through theoretical analysis based on the algorithm's structure and operations. Here's how you might approach this:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Understand the Algorithm's Operations:**\n",
        "   - Analyze each part of the algorithm and identify the basic operations (like comparisons, assignments, arithmetic operations) and how often they are performed relative to the input size.\n",
        "   - Pay special attention to loops and nested loops, as they often play a significant role in determining time complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Counting Basic Operations:**\n",
        "   - For each line of code or each operation, estimate how many times it will be executed in terms of the size of the input. For instance, a single loop from 1 to \\( n \\) suggests \\( n \\) iterations, while a nested loop might suggest \\( n^2 \\) iterations.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Big O Notation:**\n",
        "   - Express the total number of basic operations in Big O notation. This involves finding the term with the fastest-growing rate and ignoring constants and less significant terms. For example, if the total operations are \\( 5n^2 + 3n + 8 \\), the time complexity is \\( O(n^2) \\).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Consider the Worst, Average, and Best Cases:**\n",
        "   - Analyze the time complexity for different scenarios: worst-case (upper bound), average case (expected complexity for a random input), and best case (lower bound). Sometimes, the complexity might be the same for all cases, but often it varies.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Comparing Different Parts of the Algorithm:**\n",
        "   - If the algorithm has different components or phases, analyze each part separately and then combine the results. The overall complexity is dominated by the part with the highest complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Recursion:**\n",
        "   - For recursive algorithms, establish the recurrence relation describing the algorithm and solve it to find the time complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Amortized Analysis:**\n",
        "   - In some cases, especially with algorithms that have occasional expensive operations, an amortized analysis might be more appropriate. This looks at the time complexity over a sequence of operations, providing an average time per operation.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Empirical Validation (Optional):**\n",
        "   - While not necessary for theoretical analysis, sometimes running the algorithm with different input sizes and measuring the execution time can validate your theoretical complexity analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's important to note that this analysis provides an upper bound on the growth rate of the execution time and does not give the exact execution time, which can depend on factors like hardware, compiler optimizations, and specifics of the input data.\n",
        "\n",
        "*for linear regression using L2 norm the time complexity is n^2, or not?*\n",
        "\n",
        "The time complexity of linear regression using the L2 norm (Ridge Regression) isn't simply \\( n^2 \\); it depends on various factors including the number of features (denoted as \\( m \\)) and the number of training samples (denoted as \\( n \\)). Let's break it down:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Using the Normal Equation:**\n",
        "   - The normal equation for Ridge Regression is \\((X^TX + \\lambda I)^{-1}X^Ty\\), where \\( X \\) is the feature matrix, \\( y \\) is the target vector, \\( \\lambda \\) is the regularization parameter, and \\( I \\) is the identity matrix.\n",
        "   - The computationally intensive step here is the matrix multiplication \\( X^TX \\) and the matrix inversion \\((X^TX + \\lambda I)^{-1}\\).\n",
        "   - The multiplication \\( X^TX \\) has a complexity of \\( O(m^2n) \\), as it involves multiplying an \\( n \\times m \\) matrix with its transpose \\( m \\times n \\).\n",
        "   - Matrix inversion typically has a complexity of \\( O(m^3) \\) using standard algorithms like Gaussian elimination.\n",
        "   - So, the overall complexity would be dominated by the higher of \\( O(m^2n) \\) and \\( O(m^3) \\).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Using Gradient Descent:**\n",
        "   - If Ridge Regression is solved using gradient descent, the time complexity per iteration is \\( O(mn) \\), since each update requires computing gradients over all \\( n \\) samples and \\( m \\) features.\n",
        "   - However, the total number of iterations needed to converge can vary widely depending on the learning rate and the specifics of the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, the time complexity of linear regression using the L2 norm is not simply \\( n^2 \\); it depends on the method used for solving the regression and the relationship between the number of features \\( m \\) and the number of samples \\( n \\). For the normal equation method, it's generally the higher of \\( O(m^2n) \\) and \\( O(m^3) \\), while for gradient descent, it's \\( O(mn) \\) per iteration."

Sequential logic is used to store the state of the automaton, which is necessary to track the current position of the tape head and the symbols that have been read (more complex, because requires a larger number of memory elements, and the logic to update the state of the automaton can be more complicated). The sequential logic is implemented using flip-flops, which are memory elements that can store a single bit of information. [Combinational Logic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinational_logic): output is a function of only the present input. Combinational logic does not have a state (memory). Combinatorial logic is used to determine the next state of the automaton and the output symbol to be written to the tape, based on the current state, the input symbol, and the contents of the tape. Combinational logic is used in computer circuits to perform Boolean algebra on input signals and on stored data. The ALU is constructed using combinational logic, also half adders, full adders, half subtractors, full subtractors, multiplexers, demultiplexers, encoders and decoders, AND, OR, and NOT. The combinational logic is typically much simpler than the sequential logic. This is because the next state of the automaton and the output symbol to be written to the tape can be determined by a relatively small number of input variables.*\n",

[Closed Timelike Curves Make Quantum and Classical Computing Equivalent](https://arxiv.org/abs/0808.2669).

The Quantum OR lemma was first published in 1999 by David Deutsch and Artur Ekert. It has been used to prove lower bounds on the communication complexity of a variety of other problems, including the AND problem, the XOR problem, and the equality problem. **The Quantum OR lemma is a powerful tool for studying the power of quantum communication. It has helped to shed light on the fundamental limits of what can be achieved with quantum communication.**\n",

        "  * By understanding the quantum circuit complexity of black holes, we can gain insights into the physics of black holes and the nature of quantum gravity.\n",
        "  * Machine learning of circuits: is the ultimate physical limit of computation and data science, and we want to know how far you can push that (good framework of gravitational computer error-correction)\n",
        "  * But: What is the circuit complexity of a black hole? And  What is the computational capacity (complexity) of a black hole?\n",
        "  * Can you solve (quantum or classical) exponential or even undecidable problems in a black hole (efficiently)? Is the black hole a more powerful computer than a quantum computer or not?\n",
        "\n",
        "* Approaches: **One way**: holographic principle. Information in spacetime volume is encoded on boundary -> quantum circuit complexity of black hole can be studied by studying quantum circuit complexity of its boundary. **Another way**: AdS/CFT correspondence -> quantum circuit complexity of black hole in AdS spacetime can be studied by studying the quantum circuit complexity of CFT on boundary of AdS spacetime. **Another way**: Kerr/CFT.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Background**: Connection between Quantum information and quantum gravity: Hawking 1970s: What happens to quantum information dropped into a black hole? Black holes radiate, photons slowly come out (takes long 10^76 years for black holes of size of the sun, but does it), output is thermal / uncorrelated what came in, so information is gone. That contradicts quantum mechanics.\n",
        "  * **Dilemma:** Stays in black hole forever =› Violates quantum mechanics. Comes out in Hawking radiation =› if there's also a copy inside the black hole, seems to violate the \"No-Cloning Theorem\".\n",
        "  * **Black Hole Complementarity (modern view):** Inside is not a different state than outside, inside is just a \"re-encoding\" of exterior, so no cloning is needed to have (y) in both places. - Jumping into a black hole is just a weird way of measuring the same quantum information that you could have measured if you had stayed outside the black hole.\n",
        "  * **2012: firewall paradox**. (Almheiri et al. 2012): Qubit coming out of black hole cannot be entangled with a qubit inside the blackhole. But Hawking said if you want to see a smooth geometry of spacetime at the event horizon, the qubits need to be entangled. (In QFT spacetime is built up of a huge amount of local entanglement. No entanglement = no smooth spacetime, which means space and time end at the event horizon = the firewall). But this end of spacetime is at the singularity, not at the event horizon already).\n",
        "\n",
        "  * You can simulate gravity possibly on a standard QCs: “Even if a quantum gravity theory seems ‘wild’—even if it involves nonlocality, wormholes, and other exotica—there might be a dual description of the theory that’s more ‘tame,’ and that’s more amenable to simulation by a quantum computer.” If we wanted to simulate quantum gravity phenomena in AdS space, we might be able to do so by first translating to the CFT side, then simulating the CFT on our quantum computer, and finally translating the results back to AdS. The key point here is that, since the CFT doesn’t involve gravity, the difficulties of simulating it on a quantum computer are “merely” the relatively prosaic difficulties of simulating quantum field theory on a quantum computer. - For this to work, **the translation between the AdS and CFT descriptions also needs to be computationally efficient**—and it’s possible that there are situations where it isn’t.\n",
        "  * This means: **nature seems computable** (Penrose disagrees seems): you can build the universe out of NAND gates, see 1:00:00 [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAMjv0NAESM&t=2240s) and **Black holes seems describable** - <font color=\"red\">but to answer the final answer - if universe and black holes describable and computable - we need a theory of quantum gravity, what we don't have!</font>\n",

In this talk, I'll review this result and then give a new extension to the setting of computability theory.  Namely, I'll show that a classical or quantum computer with access to a Deutschian CTC (with no bound on its size) could solve exactly the problems that are Turing-reducible to the halting problem.  Just like in the complexity setting, the most technically interesting part is the upper bound on the power of quantum computers with access to a Deutschian CTC.\n"

In this context, \"scrambling\" refers to the way in which information that enters a black hole gets mixed up or dispersed throughout the black hole's horizon.\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Scrambling in Black Holes**: When information falls into a black hole, it doesn't get destroyed (as per the principle of quantum information conservation). Instead, it gets scrambled. This means the information is spread out across the event horizon of the black hole in a highly mixed state. It's like shuffling a deck of cards so thoroughly that the original order is completely lost.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Fastest Scramblers**: The assertion that black holes are the fastest scramblers suggests that they are extremely efficient at this process. This idea comes from the holographic principle in string theory, where the time it takes for information to scramble in a black hole is related to its size. The larger the black hole, the faster it scrambles information.\n",

        "5. **Chaos Theory and Black Holes**: The scrambling effect is also associated with chaos theory in physics, where small changes in initial conditions can lead to vastly different outcomes. In a black hole, the scrambling of information is an ultimate form of chaotic behavior.\n",

        "\n",
        "The question of whether information that has been spread out across the event horizon of a black hole can be recovered is a major topic in theoretical physics, particularly in the context of the black hole information paradox. This paradox arises from the clash between quantum mechanics, which says information cannot be destroyed, and general relativity, which suggests that information falling into a black hole is lost forever.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are some key points in this discussion:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Hawking Radiation and Information Loss**: Stephen Hawking initially proposed that black holes emit radiation (now known as Hawking radiation) and can eventually evaporate completely. This led to the paradox: if the black hole disappears, what happens to the information that fell into it? Hawking initially argued that this information is lost forever, which contradicts the principles of quantum mechanics.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Information Scrambling vs. Destruction**: While black holes are believed to scramble information almost beyond recognition, scrambling is not the same as destruction. Theoretical work, particularly in the context of the holographic principle and string theory, suggests that while information is highly scrambled, it is not necessarily destroyed.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **AdS/CFT Correspondence**: A concept from string theory called the Anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence provides a framework where the physics inside a black hole (including the fate of information) might be understood in terms of a lower-dimensional boundary, like the event horizon. This has led some physicists to propose that information is somehow encoded on the horizon and could, in principle, be recovered.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Black Hole Complementarity**: Another proposed solution is the concept of black hole complementarity, which suggests that information is both reflected at the event horizon and passes through, but no observer can confirm both realities simultaneously. This tries to reconcile the information loss with quantum mechanics without requiring information to actually be duplicated.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Firewall Hypothesis**: Some researchers have suggested the existence of a \"firewall\" at the event horizon, which would destroy any information. This hypothesis aims to resolve the paradox but is controversial and contradicts the idea that crossing a black hole's event horizon is uneventful (as predicted by general relativity).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Recent Developments**: Recent theoretical developments, including the use of quantum error correction in the context of the holographic principle, suggest that information may indeed be recoverable in principle, although the exact mechanism remains unclear.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, while it's theoretically possible that information spread out across a black hole's event horizon might be recoverable, this remains a topic of active research and debate in the fields of quantum mechanics, quantum gravity, and cosmology. The true nature of information processing by black holes continues to be one of the most intriguing puzzles in modern theoretical physics."

        "\"According to the AdS/CFT correspondence, the geometries of certain spacetimes are fully determined by quantum states that live on their boundaries-indeed, by the von Neumann entropies of portions of those boundary states. This work investigates to what extent the geometries can be reconstructed from the entropies in polynomial time. Bouland, Fefferman, and Vazirani (2019) argued that the AdS/CFT map can be exponentially complex if one wants to reconstruct regions such as the interiors of black holes. Our main result provides a sort of converse: we show that, in the special case of a single 1D boundary, if the input data consists of a list of entropies of contiguous boundary regions, and if the entropies satisfy a single inequality called Strong Subadditivity, then we can construct a graph model for the bulk in linear time. Moreover, the bulk graph is planar, it has O(N?) vertices (the information-theoretic minimum), and it's \"universal,\" with only the edge weights depending on the specific entropies in question. From a combinatorial perspective, our problem boils down to an \"inverse\" of the famous min-cut problem: rather than being given a graph and asked to find a min-cut, here we're given the values of min-cuts separating various sets of vertices, and need to find a weighted undirected graph consistent with those values. Our solution to this problem relies on the notion of a \"bulkless\" graph, which might be of independent interest for AdS/CFT.
