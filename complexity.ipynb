Sequential logic has state (memory). Sequential logic is used to store the state of the automaton, which is necessary to track the current position of the tape head and the symbols that have been read (more complex, because requires a larger number of memory elements, and the logic to update the state of the automaton can be more complicated). The sequential logic is implemented using flip-flops, which are memory elements that can store a single bit of information. [Combinational Logic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinational_logic): output is a function of only the present input. Combinational logic does not have a state (memory). Combinatorial logic is used to determine the next state of the automaton and the output symbol to be written to the tape, based on the current state, the input symbol, and the contents of the tape. Combinational logic is used in computer circuits to perform Boolean algebra on input signals and on stored data. The ALU is constructed using combinational logic, also half adders, full adders, half subtractors, full subtractors, multiplexers, demultiplexers, encoders and decoders, AND, OR, and NOT. The combinational logic is typically much simpler than the sequential logic. This is because the next state of the automaton and the output symbol to be written to the tape can be determined by a relatively small number of input variables.*\n",

The higher the bandgap, the more energy it takes for an electron to move from the valence band to the conduction band.\n",

Ever since then semiconductor manufacturers have been racing to see who can make the fastest, smallest, lowest power, highest performance transistors. - Apple’s iPhone XS uses 7 nanometer transistors. So let’s estimate how many atoms are in one of them. Excluding the connecting wires and other parts, I’m just going to calculate the size of the active part, the “channel” under the gate. The volume of the channel is about (7 nm long) x (7 nm deep) x (20 nm wide). The atomic density of silicon is 5E+28 atoms per cubic meter. Number of atoms n = volume x density = n = (980E-27) x (5E+28) = 49,000 atoms. [Source](https://www.quora.com/How-many-atoms-are-in-a-typical-transistor-in-a-chip#)\n"

        "  2. **Lack of Suitable Bandgap:** Suitable semiconductor materials need a bandgap that allows for effective control of electrical conductivity. Smaller atoms typically do not form materials with the desired semiconductor properties. Semiconductor materials need to have a specific bandgap that allows them to conduct electricity when necessary (by promoting electrons from the valence band to the conduction band) and act as insulators otherwise. This bandgap is typically in the range of 1-2 eV.\n",

        "\n",
        "6. Summary\n",
        "While smaller atoms than silicon can be involved in semiconductor processes (e.g., oxygen in SiO₂ or hydrogen in passivation), they are not suitable as primary materials for transistors. Suitable alternatives to silicon typically involve elements that can form stable, semiconductor-like materials with appropriate electrical properties, such as those mentioned previously (e.g., carbon in graphene, elements in TMDs like molybdenum and tungsten, and others).\n",
        "\n",

        "* The clock speed measures the number of cycles your CPU executes per second, measured in GHz (gigahertz). In this case, a “cycle” is the basic unit that measures a CPU's speed. During each cycle, billions of transistors within the processor open and close.\n",
        "* There are a few reasons why CPU clock speed is not increasing anymore. See article: [why-cpu-clock-speed-isnt-increasing](https://www.maketecheasier.com/why-cpu-clock-speed-isnt-increasing/)\n",
        "* **The physical limits of transistors.** Transistors are the basic building blocks of a CPU, and they can only switch so fast. As transistors get smaller, they also get slower. This is because the distance between the transistors gets smaller, and the electrons have to travel a shorter distance to switch them on and off.\n",
        "* **The power consumption of CPUs.** As the clock speed of a CPU increases, so does its power consumption. This is because the transistors have to switch more often, and this requires more energy.\n",
        "* **The heat generated by CPUs.** When a CPU consumes more power, it also generates more heat. This heat can cause the CPU to throttle its clock speed, or even shut down, to prevent damage.\n",
        "* As a result of these factors, CPU manufacturers have shifted their focus to other ways to improve CPU performance, such as increasing the number of cores and using new technologies like multithreading.\n",
        "* Here are some of the ways that CPU manufacturers are increasing performance without increasing clock speed:\n",

        "  * **Using multithreading.** Multithreading allows a single core to run multiple tasks by dividing each task into smaller parts that can be executed independently.\n",

        "* Jens Eisert: Fundamental limits to quantum computation: Quantum computers promise superior computational power over classical computers for some structured problems. While this insight is not new, only in recent years, steps have been taken to actually build intermediate-sized quantum devices, creating an exciting state of affairs. For some paradigmatic problems, there is some evidence that quantum computers may outperform classical devices [1]. For practically motivated problems in machine learning [2, 3] and in optimization [4], fault tolerant quantum computers indeed perform better than classical ones. While this may be promising, actual systems to date are relatively small and noisy. The main part of the talk is concerned with identifying *limitations* to quantum computing in this realm. We discuss notions of learnability of output distributions of short quantum circuits - as they can be seen as parts of variational quantum algorithms - and find that a single T-gate renders learning them hard [5]. We identify exponentially tighter bounds on limitations of quantum error mitigation [6]. We finally discuss the impact of non-unital noise on quantum computing, with quite unexpected results [7]. We end on the note that while fault tolerant quantum computers offer substantial computational benefits, the race is still open for near-term quantum devices.

        "  * No, nature is not np-hard, makes mistakes also in protein folding: Nature can <u>not</u> solve all np problems (like soap bubbles is a myth). Scott aaronson: doing the soap experiment: you need to repeat the trial several times, it does not always find the best solution. it seems to find a local optimum mostly. Prions in protein: local optima! Scott Aaronson: [Black Holes, Firewalls, and the Limits of Quantum Computers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cstKRACrMQY&t=2446). And it cannot scale to large number of nails. **In the case of soap bubbles, nature just seems to apply a really fast approximation which is accurate for small cases but breaks down at larger instances** (due to actual physical properties... i.e. it is physically impossible to build arbitrarily thin rods to dip into soapy water.) Many other NP-problems can be modeled as physical systems in which a lowest-energy-state would correspond to a solution to the combinatorial problem. You can find that \"DNA computing\" solves the clique problem, for instance. [Source](https://groups.google.com/g/comp.theory/c/11lY926-P7M?pli=1)\n",

Dazu haben die Fachleute jeweils »notwendige Bedingungen« aus den Theorien extrahiert, die ein System besitzen müsste, um ein Bewusstsein zu besitzen. Je mehr dieser notwendigen Anforderungen ein System erfülle, so die Argumentation, desto wahrscheinlicher sei es bewusst.\n",
