        "The problem of multiplying matrices, specifically 3x3 matrices, has been the subject of extensive research in an effort to find more efficient algorithms. Traditional matrix multiplication has a time complexity of $O(n^3)$ but more advanced methods seek to reduce this complexity by minimizing the number of scalar multiplications required. The best known bilinear algorithm for multiplying 3x3 matrices uses 23 essential multiplications, which is fewer than the 27 multiplications required by the straightforward method.\n",

Dies wird durch eine rekursive Aufteilung der Matrizen erreicht, wobei durch clevere Berechnungen die Anzahl der benötigten Multiplikationen reduziert wird.\n",

        "1. **Aufteilung der Matrizen:**\n",
        "   - Angenommen, wir haben zwei Matrizen \\( A \\) und \\( B \\) der Größe \\( 2^n \\times 2^n \\). Diese werden in vier gleich große Submatrizen aufgeteilt:\n",

Sequential logic has state (memory). Sequential logic is used to store the state of the automaton, which is necessary to track the current position of the tape head and the symbols that have been read (more complex, because requires a larger number of memory elements, and the logic to update the state of the automaton can be more complicated). The sequential logic is implemented using flip-flops, which are memory elements that can store a single bit of information. [Combinational Logic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinational_logic): output is a function of only the present input. Combinational logic does not have a state (memory). Combinatorial logic is used to determine the next state of the automaton and the output symbol to be written to the tape, based on the current state, the input symbol, and the contents of the tape. Combinational logic is used in computer circuits to perform Boolean algebra on input signals and on stored data. The ALU is constructed using combinational logic, also half adders, full adders, half subtractors, full subtractors, multiplexers, demultiplexers, encoders and decoders, AND, OR, and NOT. The combinational logic is typically much simpler than the sequential logic. This is because the next state of the automaton and the output symbol to be written to the tape can be determined by a relatively small number of input variables.*\n",

        "* Steps to Execute Addition\n",
        "  1. **Fetch**: The CPU fetches the instruction from memory. In this case, the instruction is an addition operation, such as `ADD R1, R2, R3` (which means add the contents of register R2 and R3, and store the result in register R1).\n",
        "  2. **Decode**: The instruction decoder interprets the fetched instruction. It identifies that this is an addition operation and determines the source and destination registers.\n",

        "  4. **Execute (Addition Operation)**: The ALU receives the operands from the registers. The ALU uses a network of logic gates to perform the addition. Here’s a simplified breakdown of what happens inside the ALU during this step:\n",
        "     - **Binary Addition**: At the hardware level, addition is performed in binary. Each bit of the operands is added using a combination of logic gates (AND, OR, XOR, etc.).\n",

However, hydrogen is used in semiconductor processes, such as hydrogenation to passivate defects in silicon.

Smaller atoms typically do not form materials with the desired semiconductor properties. Semiconductor materials need to have a specific bandgap that allows them to conduct electricity when necessary (by promoting electrons from the valence band to the conduction band) and act as insulators otherwise. This bandgap is typically in the range of 1-2 eV.\n",

In this work, we construct examples of constant description length but exponential circuit complexity. We provide infinite families such that each element requires an exponential number of two-qubit gates to be generated exactly from a product and where the same is true for the approximate generation of the vast majority of elements in the family.

While this insight is not new, only in recent years, steps have been taken to actually build intermediate-sized quantum devices, creating an exciting state of affairs. For some paradigmatic problems, there is some evidence that quantum computers may outperform classical devices [1]. For practically motivated problems in machine learning [2, 3] and in optimization [4], fault tolerant quantum computers indeed perform better than classical ones. While this may be promising, actual systems to date are relatively small and noisy. The main part of the talk is concerned with identifying *limitations* to quantum computing in this realm. We discuss notions of learnability of output distributions of short quantum circuits - as they can be seen as parts of variational quantum algorithms - and find that a single T-gate renders learning them hard [5]. We identify exponentially tighter bounds on limitations of quantum error mitigation [6]. We finally discuss the impact of non-unital noise on quantum computing, with quite unexpected results [7]. We end on the note that while fault tolerant quantum computers offer substantial computational benefits, the race is still open for near-term quantum devices.

Essentially, if you move along a Killing vector, the geometry of the space does not change. In general relativity, Killing vectors are used to identify symmetries of spacetime. For example, in a spacetime that is symmetric in time, there will be a Killing vector corresponding to this time symmetry. Similarly, in a spherically symmetric space, there are Killing vectors corresponding to rotational symmetries.\n",

This is a concept that is particularly important in the study of black holes. In simple terms, a Killing horizon is often associated with the event horizon of a black hole. It is the region where the Killing vector, which represents a certain symmetry (like time translation symmetry), becomes null. This means that at the horizon, the concepts of time and space as understood in normal circumstances become intertwined in a way that is characteristic of the relativistic effects near a black hole.\n",

        "  * work on black hole horizon singularities, I asked whether other effects could give rise to such phenomena. My previous work on effective field theories (EFTs), particularly development of physics models with quantum corrections, gave me an idea. Talking with Horowitz, I wondered whether the higher-derivative terms in a gravitational EFT (i.e., quantum corrections to the Einstein equations) could themselves lead to singularities on the horizons of extreme black holes.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "  * the researchers considered Einstein gravity coupled to its leading quantum corrections: \"The Einstein equations are linear in the Riemann tensor, a mathematical object describing the curvature of spacetime,\" Remmen explained. \"In three space dimensions, the leading corrections to Einstein are terms that are cubic (third power) and quartic (fourth power) in the curvature. Because curvature is a measure of derivatives of the spacetime geometry, such terms are called 'higher-derivative terms.' We calculated the effect of these higher-derivative terms on rapidly spinning black holes.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "  * \"Surprisingly, EFT corrections make the singularity jump all the way from the center of the black hole out to the horizon, where you wouldn't expect it to be,\" Remmen said. \"The value of the coefficient in front of a given EFT term—the 'dial settings' in the laws of physics—are dictated by the couplings and types of particle that are present at high energies and short distances. In this sense, EFT coefficients are sensitive to new physics.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Kolanowski, Horowitz, Remmen and Santos also found that the strength of the divergence in tides at the horizon of extremal black holes, and the possible occurrence of tidal singularity, heavily depends on the EFT coefficients. The results of their calculations thus suggest that the spacetime geometry near the horizon of these black holes is sensitive to new physics at higher energies.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * \"Interestingly, this unexpected singularity is present for the values of these EFT coefficients generated by the Standard Model of particle physics,\" Remmen said.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * \"Our results are surprising, since they imply that the low-energy description of physics can break down in a situation where you wouldn't expect that to happen. In physics, there's usually a sense of 'decoupling' between different distance scales. For example, you don't need to know the details of water molecules to describe waves using hydrodynamics. Yet for rapidly spinning black holes, that's precisely what happens: the low-energy EFT breaks down at the horizon.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Overall, the calculations carried out by this team of researchers hint at the promise of extremal Kerr black holes for probing new physical phenomena. While the horizon of these black holes can be very large, it was not expected to have an infinitely large curvature (i.e., infinite tidal forces) in the EFT. Their results show that it does.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * \"In future work, we are interested in exploring whether the singularities can be resolved by ultraviolet physics,\" Remmen added. \"A pressing question is whether the sensitivity of the horizon to new physics persists all the way to the Planck scale, or whether the horizon 'smooths out' at the short-distance scale associated with the EFT. We are also looking for other situations in which short distance effects might show up unexpected at large distances.\"\n",

In this talk, I'll review this result and then give a new extension to the setting of computability theory.  Namely, I'll show that a classical or quantum computer with access to a Deutschian CTC (with no bound on its size) could solve exactly the problems that are Turing-reducible to the halting problem.  Just like in the complexity setting, the most technically interesting part is the upper bound on the power of quantum computers with access to a Deutschian CTC."

In fact, this distance is not only intuitive from a mathematical perspective, it also has an operational interpretation: The maximal success probability in distinghuishing $\\rho, \\sigma \\in \\mathcal{S}\\left(\\mathbb{C}^d\\right)$, assuming that either of the two is prepared with probability $1 / 2$, by performing a 2-outcome measurement on a single copy of the unknown state is given by $\\sup _{E \\in \\mathcal{E}(\\mathrm{C})} \\operatorname{tr}[E(\\rho-\\sigma)]+\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{\\|\\rho-\\sigma\\|_1+1}{2}$ (see, e.g., $[17$, Chapter 9$]$ for a derivation).\n",
        "  * The trace distance is defined as half of the trace norm of the difference of the matrices\n",
        "  * The trace norm (also known as the nuclear norm) is a specific case of Schatten p-norm when p=1. It's the sum of singular values of a matrix. Sometimes, in the context of regularizing machine learning models, these norms are considered to constrain the learning capacity of the model. The trace of the Fisher Information Matrix can give a measure of the average sensitivity of the log-likelihood to parameter changes.\n",

        "  * When the Fisher information matrix is degenerate, it means that there is some uncertainty in the estimation of the parameters that cannot be reduced by increasing the sample size. This is because the Fisher information matrix is a measure of the amount of information that the data contains about the parameters.\n",
        "  * Degenerate Fisher information matrices can be a problem in statistical inference, as they can lead to biased and inefficient estimates of the parameters. However, there are a number of ways to deal with degenerate Fisher information matrices, such as:\n",

        "**[Distances](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance), especially [Statistical distances](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_distance): quantify separation between two elements. Can be defined on a wider variety of spaces than metrics and are often more interpretable than metrics. Distances can be more flexible than metrics: can be defined on a wider variety of spaces when data is not Euclidean (no natural notion of distance like in text, images, or graphs), data is noisy (more robust), or data is imbalanced. Is a weaker notion than that of the metric (there is no triangle inequality).**\n",

        "* [Manhattan distance (taxicab)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry): defined as sum of absolute values of the differences between the corresponding components of two vectors. The Manhattan distance is not symmetric, which means that the distance between two points is not the same as the distance between the reverse of the two points.\n",

        "* [Jaccard distance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index): size of intersection of two sets divided by size of the union of the two sets. The Jaccard distance is not a metric because it does not satisfy the triangle inequality. The Jaccard distance is used for text classification tasks. It is defined as the size of the intersection of two sets divided by the size of the union of the two sets.\n",

Example in discrete space: [Kendall tau distance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_tau_distance): is a measure of the similarity between two rankings of a set of objects. It is defined as the number of pairs of objects that are ranked in opposite order in the two rankings, divided by the total number of pairs of objects. The Kendall tau distance is not a metric because it does not satisfy the triangle inequality.\n",

        "* [Wasserstein distance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasserstein_metric) (Earth Mover’s Distance): comparing probability distributions. The Wasserstein distance is not a metric for comparing vectors. Depending on the order parameter \\( p \\), it might not satisfy the triangle inequality property. When \\( p = 1 \\), it is a metric, but for other values of \\( p \\), it might not be. Is used for image segmentation tasks. It is defined as the minimum amount of work required to move one set of pixels to another set of pixels.  The Wasserstein distance is used where the data is represented as probability distributions. It is defined as the minimum cost of transporting one distribution to another.\n",
        "* Squared Euclidean distance is also a distance measure in a broader sense, as it quantifies the separation between two points in a Euclidean space. Squared Euclidean distance is also a divergence, specifically a special case of a Bregman divergence for a certain choice of generating function when the generating convex function is a quadratic function -  In this context, it represents a measure of divergence between two points in the space.\n",

        "* [Mahalanobis distance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahalanobis_distance) is a measure of the distance between a point P and a distribution D, used in multivariate anomaly detection, classification on highly imbalanced datasets and one-class classification. If each of these axes is re-scaled to have unit variance, then the Mahalanobis distance corresponds to standard Euclidean distance in the transformed space. The Mahalanobis distance is thus unitless and scale-invariant, and takes into account the correlations of the data set. In statistics, the covariance matrix of the data is sometimes used to define a distance metric called Mahalanobis distance. The Mahalanobis distance does not satisfy the triangle inequality because it can be zero even if the two points are not the same. This can happen if the covariance matrix is singular. It is often used in multivariate anomaly detection, classification, and regression. [Mahalanobis distance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahalanobis_distance) is useful when dealing with variables measured in different scales (so the units of measure become standardized) and also, in order to avoid correlation issues between these variables.\n",
