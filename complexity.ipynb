Quantum entanglement is a crucial resource for many quantum algorithms, and its generation and manipulation significantly affect the complexity of a quantum circuit. Here’s how they are related:\n",

        "*Quantum Entanglement in Quantum Circuits*\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Definition and Importance**:\n",
        "   - Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where qubits become correlated in such a way that the state of one qubit cannot be described independently of the state of another, even if they are far apart.\n",
        "   - It is a key feature that distinguishes quantum computing from classical computing, enabling powerful quantum algorithms like Shor’s factoring algorithm and Grover’s search algorithm.\n",

        "   - In some algorithms, higher entanglement can reduce the need for deep circuits or a large number of gates, but it may require more qubits.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Complexity Classes**:\n",

        "3. **Entanglement Measures and Circuit Design**:\n",
        "   - Measures like entanglement entropy quantify the amount of entanglement in a quantum state and help in analyzing the circuit's complexity.\n",

        "In summary, quantum entanglement is both a resource and a challenge in designing quantum circuits. Its generation and manipulation significantly impact the quantum circuit’s complexity, influencing the number of gates, depth, and qubits required.

        "\n",
        "1. **L2 Norm (Ridge Regression - \\( p = 2 \\)):**\n",
        "   - Ridge regression adds a regularization term equal to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients (L2 norm) to the loss function. The computational complexity of ridge regression is similar to ordinary linear regression. The solving process involves matrix operations that are computationally intensive (like inversion), but these operations don't significantly increase in complexity with the addition of the L2 term.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **L1 Norm (Lasso Regression - \\( p = 1 \\)):**\n",
        "   - Lasso regression uses the absolute value of the coefficients (L1 norm) as the regularization term. The main computational challenge with Lasso is that the absolute value function is not differentiable at zero, which complicates the optimization process. Specialized algorithms like coordinate descent are used, and the complexity can be higher compared to ridge regression, especially for high-dimensional data. However, this increased complexity is more due to the nature of the L1 norm rather than its size.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Higher p-norms:**\n",
        "   - In practice, norms higher than L2 are rarely used in linear regression. Theoretically, as \\( p \\) increases beyond 2, the optimization problem can become more challenging due to the increasing non-linearity and non-convexity of the norm. This could potentially lead to higher computational complexity, but such cases are not common in standard linear regression problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the increase in computational complexity with different p-norms in linear regression is less about the size of \\( p \\) and more about the mathematical and computational characteristics of the norms themselves. L1 and L2 norms are the most commonly used, with L1 (Lasso) generally posing more computational challenges due to its non-differentiability at zero. Higher p-norms are not standard in linear regression and could potentially introduce more complex optimization challenges.\n",

        "*Why do higher p-norms show increasing non-linearity and non-convexity of the norm?*\n",
        "\n",
        "Higher p-norms exhibit increasing non-linearity and non-convexity due to the mathematical properties of the norms themselves. To understand this, let's first define the p-norm for a vector \\( \\mathbf{x} \\) in \\( \\mathbb{R}^n \\):\n",
        "\n",
        "\\[ \\|\\mathbf{x}\\|_p = \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |x_i|^p \\right)^{\\frac{1}{p}} \\]\n",
        "\n",
        "As \\( p \\) increases, the behavior of this norm changes:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Increasing Non-Linearity:**\n",
        "   - For \\( p < 1 \\), the p-norm is non-convex. As \\( p \\) approaches 1, the function becomes linear in nature (the L1 norm or Manhattan norm). Beyond \\( p = 1 \\), including the commonly used \\( p = 2 \\) (Euclidean norm), the function is convex but exhibits increasing non-linearity as \\( p \\) increases.\n",
        "   - The non-linearity arises because higher powers increasingly magnify larger components of the vector more than smaller ones. For instance, in the case of \\( p = 2 \\), squaring each component treats all components equally in terms of their sign but not in terms of their magnitude. As \\( p \\) increases further, this effect becomes more pronounced, leading to a function that responds very non-linearly to changes in the input vector.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Non-Convexity for \\( p > 1 \\):**\n",
        "   - For \\( p > 1 \\), the p-norms are always convex. This convexity is a crucial property for many optimization problems, including those in machine learning, as it ensures that any local minimum is also a global minimum.\n",
        "   - However, as \\( p \\) increases, the shape of the function becomes more \"peaky\" or \"sharp\" around the axes. This can be intuitively understood: for very large \\( p \\), the p-norm is heavily influenced by the largest component of the vector, almost ignoring the smaller components. This behavior can lead to a function that, while still convex, has very steep gradients near the axes, making optimization more challenging.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Practical Implications:**\n",
        "   - In optimization problems, such as those in machine learning, these properties have significant implications. Non-linear, sharp functions can lead to optimization challenges, such as difficulty in finding the global minimum due to steep gradients or flat regions.\n",
        "   - Moreover, the computational cost of evaluating higher p-norms can be significant, as it involves raising each component of the vector to a high power and then taking a root, operations that are more computationally intensive than those required for lower p-norms.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the increase in non-linearity and the specific convexity shape of higher p-norms are inherent to their mathematical definition. These properties influence their practical use in fields like machine learning, where lower p-norms (like L1 and L2) are preferred due to their balance of computational feasibility and desirable optimization properties. Higher p-norms, while theoretically interesting, often present practical challenges for optimization.\n",
        "\n",
        "*How can you quantify the computational cost?*\n",
        "\n",
        "Quantifying the computational cost of an algorithm or a computational process involves assessing several factors, such as time complexity, space complexity, and the actual execution time and memory usage in practice. Here's a breakdown of how these are typically quantified:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Time Complexity:**\n",
        "   - Time complexity is a theoretical measure of the execution time of an algorithm as a function of the size of the input data. It's usually expressed in Big O notation (like O(n), O(n^2), O(log n)), which describes the upper limit of the growth rate of the runtime.\n",
        "   - This measure helps to understand how the execution time will increase as the input size grows. It's crucial for comparing different algorithms, especially in terms of their scalability.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Space Complexity:**\n",
        "   - Space complexity measures the amount of memory an algorithm needs in terms of the size of the input data. Like time complexity, it's also expressed in Big O notation.\n",
        "   - This aspect is important in scenarios where memory is a limiting factor, such as in embedded systems or when dealing with extremely large data sets.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Actual Execution Time:**\n",
        "   - The actual execution time is the real-time an algorithm takes to complete. This can be measured by running the algorithm and timing its execution.\n",
        "   - The actual execution time can vary based on several factors, including the hardware used, the efficiency of the implementation, and the specific characteristics of the input data.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Actual Memory Usage:**\n",
        "   - This is a practical measurement of the amount of memory used by an algorithm when it runs. It can be measured using profiling tools.\n",
        "   - Actual memory usage can vary from the theoretical space complexity due to factors like the efficiency of the memory allocation in the implementation and overheads imposed by the system or the programming environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Algorithmic Efficiency:**\n",
        "   - Efficiency takes into account both time and space complexity. An efficient algorithm is one that has both a lower time complexity and a lower space complexity.\n",
        "   - In practice, there's often a trade-off between time and space efficiency (known as the time-space trade-off). Optimizing for one can lead to increased usage of the other.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Profiling and Benchmarking:**\n",
        "   - In practice, profiling and benchmarking are used to quantify the computational cost of an algorithm. Profiling involves running the algorithm with specific tools to measure various performance metrics like execution time and memory usage.\n",
        "   - Benchmarking involves comparing these performance metrics under different conditions or against other algorithms to assess relative performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, quantifying computational cost involves a mix of theoretical analysis (time and space complexity) and practical measurements (actual execution time and memory usage). This assessment helps in understanding the efficiency of an algorithm and its suitability for a particular application, especially when resources are limited or when dealing with large-scale problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "*could you quantify the Time Complexity in advance without running the function?*\n",
        "\n",
        "Yes, you can quantify the time complexity of an algorithm in advance without actually running the function. This is typically done through theoretical analysis based on the algorithm's structure and operations. Here's how you might approach this:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Understand the Algorithm's Operations:**\n",
        "   - Analyze each part of the algorithm and identify the basic operations (like comparisons, assignments, arithmetic operations) and how often they are performed relative to the input size.\n",
        "   - Pay special attention to loops and nested loops, as they often play a significant role in determining time complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Counting Basic Operations:**\n",
        "   - For each line of code or each operation, estimate how many times it will be executed in terms of the size of the input. For instance, a single loop from 1 to \\( n \\) suggests \\( n \\) iterations, while a nested loop might suggest \\( n^2 \\) iterations.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Big O Notation:**\n",
        "   - Express the total number of basic operations in Big O notation. This involves finding the term with the fastest-growing rate and ignoring constants and less significant terms. For example, if the total operations are \\( 5n^2 + 3n + 8 \\), the time complexity is \\( O(n^2) \\).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Consider the Worst, Average, and Best Cases:**\n",
        "   - Analyze the time complexity for different scenarios: worst-case (upper bound), average case (expected complexity for a random input), and best case (lower bound). Sometimes, the complexity might be the same for all cases, but often it varies.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Comparing Different Parts of the Algorithm:**\n",
        "   - If the algorithm has different components or phases, analyze each part separately and then combine the results. The overall complexity is dominated by the part with the highest complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Recursion:**\n",
        "   - For recursive algorithms, establish the recurrence relation describing the algorithm and solve it to find the time complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Amortized Analysis:**\n",
        "   - In some cases, especially with algorithms that have occasional expensive operations, an amortized analysis might be more appropriate. This looks at the time complexity over a sequence of operations, providing an average time per operation.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Empirical Validation (Optional):**\n",
        "   - While not necessary for theoretical analysis, sometimes running the algorithm with different input sizes and measuring the execution time can validate your theoretical complexity analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's important to note that this analysis provides an upper bound on the growth rate of the execution time and does not give the exact execution time, which can depend on factors like hardware, compiler optimizations, and specifics of the input data.\n",
        "\n",
        "*for linear regression using L2 norm the time complexity is n^2, or not?*\n",
        "\n",
        "The time complexity of linear regression using the L2 norm (Ridge Regression) isn't simply \\( n^2 \\); it depends on various factors including the number of features (denoted as \\( m \\)) and the number of training samples (denoted as \\( n \\)). Let's break it down:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Using the Normal Equation:**\n",
        "   - The normal equation for Ridge Regression is \\((X^TX + \\lambda I)^{-1}X^Ty\\), where \\( X \\) is the feature matrix, \\( y \\) is the target vector, \\( \\lambda \\) is the regularization parameter, and \\( I \\) is the identity matrix.\n",
        "   - The computationally intensive step here is the matrix multiplication \\( X^TX \\) and the matrix inversion \\((X^TX + \\lambda I)^{-1}\\).\n",
        "   - The multiplication \\( X^TX \\) has a complexity of \\( O(m^2n) \\), as it involves multiplying an \\( n \\times m \\) matrix with its transpose \\( m \\times n \\).\n",
        "   - Matrix inversion typically has a complexity of \\( O(m^3) \\) using standard algorithms like Gaussian elimination.\n",
        "   - So, the overall complexity would be dominated by the higher of \\( O(m^2n) \\) and \\( O(m^3) \\).\n",
        "\n",

Sequential logic has state (memory). Sequential logic is used to store the state of the automaton, which is necessary to track the current position of the tape head and the symbols that have been read (more complex, because requires a larger number of memory elements, and the logic to update the state of the automaton can be more complicated). The sequential logic is implemented using flip-flops, which are memory elements that can store a single bit of information. [Combinational Logic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinational_logic): output is a function of only the present input. Combinational logic does not have a state (memory). Combinatorial logic is used to determine the next state of the automaton and the output symbol to be written to the tape, based on the current state, the input symbol, and the contents of the tape. Combinational logic is used in computer circuits to perform Boolean algebra on input signals and on stored data. The ALU is constructed using combinational logic, also half adders, full adders, half subtractors, full subtractors, multiplexers, demultiplexers, encoders and decoders, AND, OR, and NOT. The combinational logic is typically much simpler than the sequential logic. This is because the next state of the automaton and the output symbol to be written to the tape can be determined by a relatively small number of input variables.*\n",

In this work, we construct examples of constant description length but exponential circuit complexity. We provide infinite families such that each element requires an exponential number of two-qubit gates to be generated exactly from a product and where the same is true for the approximate generation of the vast majority of elements in the family.

While this insight is not new, only in recent years, steps have been taken to actually build intermediate-sized quantum devices, creating an exciting state of affairs. For some paradigmatic problems, there is some evidence that quantum computers may outperform classical devices [1]. For practically motivated problems in machine learning [2, 3] and in optimization [4], fault tolerant quantum computers indeed perform better than classical ones. While this may be promising, actual systems to date are relatively small and noisy. The main part of the talk is concerned with identifying *limitations* to quantum computing in this realm. We discuss notions of learnability of output distributions of short quantum circuits - as they can be seen as parts of variational quantum algorithms - and find that a single T-gate renders learning them hard [5]. We identify exponentially tighter bounds on limitations of quantum error mitigation [6]. We finally discuss the impact of non-unital noise on quantum computing, with quite unexpected results [7]. We end on the note that while fault tolerant quantum computers offer substantial computational benefits, the race is still open for near-term quantum devices.

        "* Steps to Execute Addition\n",
        "  1. **Fetch**: The CPU fetches the instruction from memory. In this case, the instruction is an addition operation, such as `ADD R1, R2, R3` (which means add the contents of register R2 and R3, and store the result in register R1).\n",
        "  2. **Decode**: The instruction decoder interprets the fetched instruction. It identifies that this is an addition operation and determines the source and destination registers.\n",

        "  4. **Execute (Addition Operation)**: The ALU receives the operands from the registers. The ALU uses a network of logic gates to perform the addition. Here’s a simplified breakdown of what happens inside the ALU during this step:\n",
        "     - **Binary Addition**: At the hardware level, addition is performed in binary. Each bit of the operands is added using a combination of logic gates (AND, OR, XOR, etc.).\n",
        "     - **Full Adder Circuits**: The ALU typically uses full adder circuits, which can add two binary digits along with a carry bit. Each bit position of the operands is processed by a full adder.\n",
        "     - **Ripple Carry Adder**: In simple ALUs, multiple full adders are connected in a ripple carry adder configuration, where the carry output from each bit addition is input to the next bit addition.\n",
        "   - For a 32-bit integer addition, the ALU will have 32 full adders working in parallel, one for each bit position.\n",
        "  5. **Write Back**: The result of the addition is written back to the destination register (R1 in this case). The ALU sends the result to the register file, where it is stored in R1.\n",
        "* Example: 4-bit Full Adder, consider a 4-bit full adder (for simplicity):\n",
        "  1. **Bitwise Addition**: Each bit of the operands is added separately.\n",
        "  2. **Carry Propagation**: Each bit addition produces a sum and a carry. The carry from each bit addition is propagated to the next higher bit.\n",
        "  3. **Logic Gates**: Each full adder uses a combination of AND, OR, and XOR gates to compute the sum and carry.\n",

        "- **Suitability for Transistors:** While oxygen is crucial for forming insulating layers (such as SiO₂) in semiconductor devices, it is not suitable as a primary material for transistors. Oxygen does not have the semiconductor properties needed for such applications.\n",

        "- **Suitability for Transistors:** Hydrogen itself is not suitable for forming semiconductor materials. However, hydrogen is used in semiconductor processes, such as hydrogenation to passivate defects in silicon. Hydrogen molecules do not have a bandgap in the range required for semiconductor applications. Hydrogen is highly reactive. Hydrogen naturally exists as diatomic molecules (H₂) at standard conditions, which do not form a solid with the necessary crystal lattice structure required for semiconductor materials.\n",

        "  1. **Chemical Reactivity:** Many smaller atoms are highly reactive and do not form stable semiconductor materials.\n",
        "  2. **Lack of Suitable Bandgap:** Suitable semiconductor materials need a bandgap that allows for effective control of electrical conductivity. Smaller atoms typically do not form materials with the desired semiconductor properties. Semiconductor materials need to have a specific bandgap that allows them to conduct electricity when necessary (by promoting electrons from the valence band to the conduction band) and act as insulators otherwise. This bandgap is typically in the range of 1-2 eV.\n",
        "  3. **Structural Stability:** Many smaller atoms do not form stable crystal structures needed for semiconductor applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Summary\n",
        "While smaller atoms than silicon can be involved in semiconductor processes (e.g., oxygen in SiO₂ or hydrogen in passivation), they are not suitable as primary materials for transistors. Suitable alternatives to silicon typically involve elements that can form stable, semiconductor-like materials with appropriate electrical properties, such as those mentioned previously (e.g., carbon in graphene, elements in TMDs like molybdenum and tungsten, and others).\n",
        "\n",
        "The miniaturization of transistors focuses on materials that can maintain electrical integrity and performance at the nanoscale, rather than simply using smaller atoms."

        "* The clock speed measures the number of cycles your CPU executes per second, measured in GHz (gigahertz). In this case, a “cycle” is the basic unit that measures a CPU's speed. During each cycle, billions of transistors within the processor open and close.\n",
        "* There are a few reasons why CPU clock speed is not increasing anymore. See article: [why-cpu-clock-speed-isnt-increasing](https://www.maketecheasier.com/why-cpu-clock-speed-isnt-increasing/)\n",
        "* **The physical limits of transistors.** Transistors are the basic building blocks of a CPU, and they can only switch so fast. As transistors get smaller, they also get slower. This is because the distance between the transistors gets smaller, and the electrons have to travel a shorter distance to switch them on and off.\n",
        "* **The power consumption of CPUs.** As the clock speed of a CPU increases, so does its power consumption. This is because the transistors have to switch more often, and this requires more energy.\n",
        "* **The heat generated by CPUs.** When a CPU consumes more power, it also generates more heat. This heat can cause the CPU to throttle its clock speed, or even shut down, to prevent damage.\n",
        "* As a result of these factors, CPU manufacturers have shifted their focus to other ways to improve CPU performance, such as increasing the number of cores and using new technologies like multithreading.\n",
        "* Here are some of the ways that CPU manufacturers are increasing performance without increasing clock speed:\n",

        "  * **Using multithreading.** Multithreading allows a single core to run multiple tasks by dividing each task into smaller parts that can be executed independently.\n",
        "  * **Using new technologies.** New technologies such as 3D stacking and chiplets are allowing CPU manufacturers to pack more transistors into a smaller space, which can improve performance without increasing clock speed.\n",

        "* **Wavefunctions:** Instead of chaotic trajectories like in classical systems, we look at quantum wavefunctions (which describe the probability of finding a particle somewhere). Wavefunctions of chaotic quantum systems tend to be highly irregular and spread out.\n",

Information in spacetime volume is encoded on boundary -> quantum circuit complexity of black hole can be studied by studying quantum circuit complexity of its boundary. **Another way**: AdS/CFT correspondence -> quantum circuit complexity of black hole in AdS spacetime can be studied by studying the quantum circuit complexity of CFT on boundary of AdS spacetime. **Another way**: Kerr/CFT.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Background**: Connection between Quantum information and quantum gravity: Hawking 1970s: What happens to quantum information dropped into a black hole? Black holes radiate, photons slowly come out (takes long 10^76 years for black holes of size of the sun, but does it), output is thermal / uncorrelated what came in, so information is gone. That contradicts quantum mechanics.\n",
        "  * **Dilemma:** Stays in black hole forever =› Violates quantum mechanics. Comes out in Hawking radiation =› if there's also a copy inside the black hole, seems to violate the \"No-Cloning Theorem\".\n",
        "  * **Black Hole Complementarity (modern view):** Inside is not a different state than outside, inside is just a \"re-encoding\" of exterior, so no cloning is needed to have (y) in both places. - Jumping into a black hole is just a weird way of measuring the same quantum information that you could have measured if you had stayed outside the black hole.\n",
        "  * **2012: firewall paradox**. (Almheiri et al. 2012): Qubit coming out of black hole cannot be entangled with a qubit inside the blackhole. But Hawking said if you want to see a smooth geometry of spacetime at the event horizon, the qubits need to be entangled. (In QFT spacetime is built up of a huge amount of local entanglement. No entanglement = no smooth spacetime, which means space and time end at the event horizon = the firewall). But this end of spacetime is at the singularity, not at the event horizon already).\n",
        "\n",
        "  * You can simulate gravity possibly on a standard QCs: “Even if a quantum gravity theory seems ‘wild’—even if it involves nonlocality, wormholes, and other exotica—there might be a dual description of the theory that’s more ‘tame,’ and that’s more amenable to simulation by a quantum computer.” If we wanted to simulate quantum gravity phenomena in AdS space, we might be able to do so by first translating to the CFT side, then simulating the CFT on our quantum computer, and finally translating the results back to AdS. The key point here is that, since the CFT doesn’t involve gravity, the difficulties of simulating it on a quantum computer are “merely” the relatively prosaic difficulties of simulating quantum field theory on a quantum computer. - For this to work, **the translation between the AdS and CFT descriptions also needs to be computationally efficient**—and it’s possible that there are situations where it isn’t.\n",
        "  * This means: **nature seems computable** (Penrose disagrees seems): you can build the universe out of NAND gates, see 1:00:00 [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAMjv0NAESM&t=2240s) and **Black holes seems describable** - <font color=\"red\">but to answer the final answer - if universe and black holes describable and computable - we need a theory of quantum gravity, what we don't have!</font>\n",

In this talk, I'll review this result and then give a new extension to the setting of computability theory.  Namely, I'll show that a classical or quantum computer with access to a Deutschian CTC (with no bound on its size) could solve exactly the problems that are Turing-reducible to the halting problem.  Just like in the complexity setting, the most technically interesting part is the upper bound on the power of quantum computers with access to a Deutschian CTC.\n"

        "**Emergent Space-Time and Quantum Error Correction**: Recent theoretical work suggests that the space-time geometry itself, especially in the context of black holes, might emerge from a kind of quantum error-correcting code. The idea is that the way information is encoded on a black hole's surface (its event horizon) might be analogous to how information is protected in a quantum error-correcting code. This means that the fabric of space-time itself could be understood as a quantum error-correcting code, which is a radical and exciting concept blending quantum mechanics, general relativity, and quantum computing."

        "**what is meant by \"Black holes are the fastest scramblers in Nature\"?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The phrase \"Black holes are the fastest scramblers in Nature\" refers to a concept in theoretical physics that describes how black holes process information. In this context, \"scrambling\" refers to the way in which information that enters a black hole gets mixed up or dispersed throughout the black hole's horizon.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are the key points to understand this concept:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Information Theory and Black Holes**: In the realm of physics, especially quantum mechanics and general relativity, information is a fundamental concept. It's often considered in terms of quantum information, which deals with the quantum states of particles.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Scrambling in Black Holes**: When information falls into a black hole, it doesn't get destroyed (as per the principle of quantum information conservation). Instead, it gets scrambled. This means the information is spread out across the event horizon of the black hole in a highly mixed state. It's like shuffling a deck of cards so thoroughly that the original order is completely lost.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Fastest Scramblers**: The assertion that black holes are the fastest scramblers suggests that they are extremely efficient at this process. This idea comes from the holographic principle in string theory, where the time it takes for information to scramble in a black hole is related to its size. The larger the black hole, the faster it scrambles information.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Implications for Quantum Physics and Gravity**: This concept is important in the study of quantum gravity and the information paradox. It suggests a deep connection between gravity (black holes) and quantum mechanics (information theory).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Chaos Theory and Black Holes**: The scrambling effect is also associated with chaos theory in physics, where small changes in initial conditions can lead to vastly different outcomes. In a black hole, the scrambling of information is an ultimate form of chaotic behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "This idea is a topic of ongoing research and debate in theoretical physics, particularly in the context of understanding the fundamental nature of black holes, quantum mechanics, and the fabric of spacetime."

        "**is it possible to recover the information, that is spread out across the event horizon of the black hole in a highly mixed state?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The question of whether information that has been spread out across the event horizon of a black hole can be recovered is a major topic in theoretical physics, particularly in the context of the black hole information paradox. This paradox arises from the clash between quantum mechanics, which says information cannot be destroyed, and general relativity, which suggests that information falling into a black hole is lost forever.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are some key points in this discussion:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Hawking Radiation and Information Loss**: Stephen Hawking initially proposed that black holes emit radiation (now known as Hawking radiation) and can eventually evaporate completely. This led to the paradox: if the black hole disappears, what happens to the information that fell into it? Hawking initially argued that this information is lost forever, which contradicts the principles of quantum mechanics.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Information Scrambling vs. Destruction**: While black holes are believed to scramble information almost beyond recognition, scrambling is not the same as destruction. Theoretical work, particularly in the context of the holographic principle and string theory, suggests that while information is highly scrambled, it is not necessarily destroyed.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **AdS/CFT Correspondence**: A concept from string theory called the Anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence provides a framework where the physics inside a black hole (including the fate of information) might be understood in terms of a lower-dimensional boundary, like the event horizon. This has led some physicists to propose that information is somehow encoded on the horizon and could, in principle, be recovered.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Black Hole Complementarity**: Another proposed solution is the concept of black hole complementarity, which suggests that information is both reflected at the event horizon and passes through, but no observer can confirm both realities simultaneously. This tries to reconcile the information loss with quantum mechanics without requiring information to actually be duplicated.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Firewall Hypothesis**: Some researchers have suggested the existence of a \"firewall\" at the event horizon, which would destroy any information. This hypothesis aims to resolve the paradox but is controversial and contradicts the idea that crossing a black hole's event horizon is uneventful (as predicted by general relativity).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Recent Developments**: Recent theoretical developments, including the use of quantum error correction in the context of the holographic principle, suggest that information may indeed be recoverable in principle, although the exact mechanism remains unclear.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, while it's theoretically possible that information spread out across a black hole's event horizon might be recoverable, this remains a topic of active research and debate in the fields of quantum mechanics, quantum gravity, and cosmology. The true nature of information processing by black holes continues to be one of the most intriguing puzzles in modern theoretical physics."

        "* Material that gets close to a rotating black hole but does not fall into it will aggregate into a circular structure known as an accretion disk. Powerful forces acting on accretion disks raise their temperature so they emit X-rays, which can act as carriers of quantum information.\n",
        "* The photons that make up the X-rays have two properties: polarisation and orbital angular momentum. Each of these can encode a qubit (quantum bit) of information, the standard information unit in quantum computing. \"Lab-based researchers already use beam splitters and prisms to entangle these properties in X-ray photons and process quantum information,\" says Racorean. \"It now seems that the curvature of spacetime around a black hole will play the same role as this apparatus.\"\n",
        "* Thus far, however, this process is only a prediction. The final proof will come when the properties of X-rays near spinning black holes are observed, which could happen in the next decade.\n",

These will investigate the polarisation of all X-rays found in space, including those emitted close to black holes. \"If we find that the X-ray polarisation changes with distance from the black hole, with those in the central region being least polarised, we will have observed entangled states that can carry quantum information,\" says Racorean.\n",
        "* This topic may seem esoteric, but it could have practical applications. **\"One day, we may even be able to use rotating black holes as quantum computers by sending [X-ray] photons on the right trajectory around these ghostly astronomical bodies,\"** Racorean concludes.\n",

        "\"According to the AdS/CFT correspondence, the geometries of certain spacetimes are fully determined by quantum states that live on their boundaries-indeed, by the von Neumann entropies of portions of those boundary states. This work investigates to what extent the geometries can be reconstructed from the entropies in polynomial time. Bouland, Fefferman, and Vazirani (2019) argued that the AdS/CFT map can be exponentially complex if one wants to reconstruct regions such as the interiors of black holes. Our main result provides a sort of converse: we show that, in the special case of a single 1D boundary, if the input data consists of a list of entropies of contiguous boundary regions, and if the entropies satisfy a single inequality called Strong Subadditivity, then we can construct a graph model for the bulk in linear time. Moreover, the bulk graph is planar, it has O(N?) vertices (the information-theoretic minimum), and it's \"universal,\" with only the edge weights depending on the specific entropies in question. From a combinatorial perspective, our problem boils down to an \"inverse\" of the famous min-cut problem: rather than being given a graph and asked to find a min-cut, here we're given the values of min-cuts separating various sets of vertices, and need to find a weighted undirected graph consistent with those values. Our solution to this problem relies on the notion of a \"bulkless\" graph, which might be of independent interest for AdS/CFT. We also make initial progress on the case of multiple 1D boundaries-where the boundaries could be connected via wormholes- including an upper bound of O (N4) vertices whenever an embeddable bulk graph exists (thus putting the problem into the complexity class\n",

These symmetries can be used to simplify the problem of calculating the complexity of black hole states and to gain new insights into the relationship between black holes and quantum information theory.\n",

This symmetry arises from the fact that black holes are solutions to the Einstein equation, which is conformally invariant. Conformal symmetry implies that the complexity of black hole states should be independent of certain transformations of the coordinates. This can be used to simplify the complexity calculations by fixing the coordinates in a particular way.\n",

Black hole states are highly entangled, and this entanglement can be exploited to reduce the computational complexity of certain tasks.

        "1. **Killing Vector**: A Killing vector field on a Riemannian manifold (which is a space where you can define distances and angles) is a vector field that represents a symmetry of the manifold. Essentially, if you move along a Killing vector, the geometry of the space does not change. In general relativity, Killing vectors are used to identify symmetries of spacetime. For example, in a spacetime that is symmetric in time, there will be a Killing vector corresponding to this time symmetry. Similarly, in a spherically symmetric space, there are Killing vectors corresponding to rotational symmetries.\n",

        "2. **Killing Horizon**: A Killing horizon is a hypersurface in spacetime on which a Killing vector field becomes null (or lightlike). This is a concept that is particularly important in the study of black holes. In simple terms, a Killing horizon is often associated with the event horizon of a black hole. It is the region where the Killing vector, which represents a certain symmetry (like time translation symmetry), becomes null. This means that at the horizon, the concepts of time and space as understood in normal circumstances become intertwined in a way that is characteristic of the relativistic effects near a black hole.\n",

        "\n",
        "  * work on black hole horizon singularities, I asked whether other effects could give rise to such phenomena. My previous work on effective field theories (EFTs), particularly development of physics models with quantum corrections, gave me an idea. Talking with Horowitz, I wondered whether the higher-derivative terms in a gravitational EFT (i.e., quantum corrections to the Einstein equations) could themselves lead to singularities on the horizons of extreme black holes.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "  * the researchers considered Einstein gravity coupled to its leading quantum corrections: \"The Einstein equations are linear in the Riemann tensor, a mathematical object describing the curvature of spacetime,\" Remmen explained. \"In three space dimensions, the leading corrections to Einstein are terms that are cubic (third power) and quartic (fourth power) in the curvature. Because curvature is a measure of derivatives of the spacetime geometry, such terms are called 'higher-derivative terms.' We calculated the effect of these higher-derivative terms on rapidly spinning black holes.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "  * \"Surprisingly, EFT corrections make the singularity jump all the way from the center of the black hole out to the horizon, where you wouldn't expect it to be,\" Remmen said. \"The value of the coefficient in front of a given EFT term—the 'dial settings' in the laws of physics—are dictated by the couplings and types of particle that are present at high energies and short distances. In this sense, EFT coefficients are sensitive to new physics.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Kolanowski, Horowitz, Remmen and Santos also found that the strength of the divergence in tides at the horizon of extremal black holes, and the possible occurrence of tidal singularity, heavily depends on the EFT coefficients. The results of their calculations thus suggest that the spacetime geometry near the horizon of these black holes is sensitive to new physics at higher energies.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * \"Interestingly, this unexpected singularity is present for the values of these EFT coefficients generated by the Standard Model of particle physics,\" Remmen said.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * \"Our results are surprising, since they imply that the low-energy description of physics can break down in a situation where you wouldn't expect that to happen. In physics, there's usually a sense of 'decoupling' between different distance scales. For example, you don't need to know the details of water molecules to describe waves using hydrodynamics. Yet for rapidly spinning black holes, that's precisely what happens: the low-energy EFT breaks down at the horizon.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Overall, the calculations carried out by this team of researchers hint at the promise of extremal Kerr black holes for probing new physical phenomena. While the horizon of these black holes can be very large, it was not expected to have an infinitely large curvature (i.e., infinite tidal forces) in the EFT. Their results show that it does.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * \"In future work, we are interested in exploring whether the singularities can be resolved by ultraviolet physics,\" Remmen added. \"A pressing question is whether the sensitivity of the horizon to new physics persists all the way to the Planck scale, or whether the horizon 'smooths out' at the short-distance scale associated with the EFT. We are also looking for other situations in which short distance effects might show up unexpected at large distances.\"\n",

        "In linear algebra, the rank of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns in the matrix. This concept is important because it provides insight into the structure of the matrix, its null space, column space, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "A \"low-rank\" matrix is a matrix where the rank is significantly less than the number of rows or columns. For example, if you have a 1000x1000 matrix (which could potentially have a rank up to 1000), but its rank is only 10, that matrix would be considered low-rank.\n",
        "\n",
        "Low-rank matrices are useful in many applications, including machine learning and data analysis. They are often used in techniques like principal component analysis (PCA) or singular value decomposition (SVD), where a high-dimensional dataset is approximated by a lower-dimensional one. This is possible because the data can often be accurately represented in a lower-dimensional space (i.e., with a low-rank matrix), which simplifies analysis and reduces computational complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the context of quantum computing, low-rank matrices are often easier to work with because they require fewer quantum resources to implement in quantum algorithms. For example, certain operations might require a number of qubits proportional to the rank of a matrix, meaning low-rank matrices can be more efficiently processed on a quantum computer."

        "\n",
        "The condition number of a matrix in linear algebra is a measure of the matrix's sensitivity to numerical errors. This number is used in the context of numerical analysis to understand the stability of a problem, specifically in the context of linear systems of equations.\n",
        "\n",
        "The condition number is calculated as the ratio of the largest singular value of a matrix to the smallest singular value. In other words, it gives us a measure of how much the output value of the function can change for a small change in the input.\n",
        "\n",
        "If a matrix has a low condition number, it means the matrix is well-conditioned, implying that the system of equations has a unique solution, and this solution can be found accurately by numerical methods. The solution will not significantly change even if the input is perturbed slightly.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, if the condition number is high, the matrix is said to be ill-conditioned. This indicates that the system is sensitive to small changes in the input, and even a slight change in the input could produce a large change in the result. Thus, the solution may not be accurately computable due to rounding errors and other numerical errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "So a low condition number in linear algebra is generally a good thing, as it indicates a stable and accurate system."

        "\n",
        "Generally, a matrix with a condition number close to 1 is considered to be well-conditioned, which means that it is not sensitive to changes in the input values. As the condition number increases, the matrix becomes increasingly ill-conditioned.\n",
        "\n",
        "As a rough rule of thumb, if the condition number κ(A) exceeds 1/ε, where ε is the machine precision (around 10^-16 for double-precision floating-point arithmetic), then the matrix is considered ill-conditioned. This is because the precision of the numerical computations might be less than the number of digits in the condition number. For example, a condition number of 10^12 would indicate that up to 12 digits of precision could be lost in the computation.\n",
        "\n",
        "In practice, condition numbers in the range of 1-10 are generally considered good, 10-100 might be cause for some concern, and 100+ is usually considered problematic, although these thresholds are rather arbitrary and can depend heavily on the specific context and precision of the computations.\n",

        "\n",
        "But it’s possible to say more than that. From reading popular articles, many people have the vague impression that a quantum computer could just try every possible solution in parallel. And if that’s all you know about them, then it’s indeed a mystery why they couldn’t solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time!\n",
        "\n",
        "The central difficulty is that, for a computer to be useful, at some point you need to measure it to observe an answer. And if you just measured an equal superposition over all possible answers, not having done anything else, the rules of QM dictate that you’ll just see a random answer. And of course, if you’d just wanted a random answer, you could’ve picked one yourself with a lot less trouble!\n",

        "So the name of the game, with every quantum algorithm, is somehow orchestrating a pattern of constructive and destructive quantum interference that boosts the probability of the correct answer (even though you yourself don’t know in advance which answer is the correct one!), and that does so efficiently. Famously, in 1994 Peter Shor showed how to do that for the problem of factoring integers, and a few related problems in number theory—but he was able to do so only by exploiting extremely special structure in those problems.\n",

        "For more “generic” search problems, like NP-complete problems, the best we generally know is Grover’s algorithm: a quantum algorithm that’s able to find the right answer (i.e., concentrate a large fraction of the amplitude on that answer) in roughly the square root of the number of steps that would be needed classically. So you get some speedup, but not an exponential one.\n",

This is the content of the so-called BBBV (Bennett, Bernstein, Brassard, Vazirani) Theorem, which has several proofs, all of them crucially relying on the linearity of unitary evolution. The BBBV Theorem gives a fundamental explanation for why any fast quantum algorithm for NP-complete problems would have to look very different from anything that we know today—much like a fast classical algorithm would have to*."

        "* The component Bernoulli variables X<sub>i</sub> are [identically distributed and independent](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_and_identically_distributed_random_variables). Prosaically, a Bernoulli process is a repeated coin flipping, possibly with an unfair coin (but with consistent unfairness).\n",

        "* In this setting, it is used, for example, in queueing theory to model random events, such as the arrival of customers at a store, phone calls at an exchange or occurrence of earthquakes, distributed in time. In the plane, the point process, also known as a spatial Poisson process, can represent the locations of scattered objects such as transmitters in a wireless network, particles colliding into a detector, or trees in a forest.\n",
        "\n",
        "* In all settings, the Poisson point process has the property that each point is stochastically independent to all the other points in the process, which is why it is sometimes called a purely or completely random process.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Despite its wide use as a stochastic model of phenomena representable as points, the inherent nature of the process implies that it does not adequately describe phenomena where there is sufficiently strong interaction between the points. This has inspired the proposal of other point processes, some of which are constructed with the Poisson point process, that seek to capture such interaction.\n",
