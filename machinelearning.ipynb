        "\"There are (at least) two possible ways to formulate precisely (i.e. mathematically) elementary\n",
        "QM. The eldest one, historically speaking, is due to von Neumann in essence, and is formulated using the language of Hilbert spaces and the spectral theory of unbounded operators. A more recent and mature formulation was developed by several authors in the attempt to solve quantum field theory problems in mathematical physics. It relies on the theory of abstract algebras (*-algebras and C* -algebras) that are built mimicking the operator algebras defined and studied, again, by von Neumann (nowadays known as W* -algebras or von Neumann algebras), but freed from the Hilbert-space structure. The core result is the celebrated GNS theorem (after Gelfand, Najmark and Segal), that we will prove in Chap. 14. The newer formulation can be considered an extension of the former one, in a very precise sense that we shall not go into here, also by virtue of the novel physical context it introduces and by the possibility of treating physical systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom, i.e. quantum fields. In particular, this second formulation makes precise sense of the demand for locality and covariance of relativistic quantum field theories, and allows to extend quantum field theories to a curved spacetime.\"\n",

The theorem states that the distribution function is constant along the trajectories of the system. That is, the total phase space volume is conserved.\n",

        "Um einen quantenmechanischen Zustand eindeutig zu charakterisieren, sind oft mehrere Observablen notwendig. Beispielsweise ist es beim Wasserstoffatom nicht ausreichend, nur die Energie anzugeben (mittels der Hauptquantenzahl n), sondern es sind zwei weitere Observablen notwendig: der Betrag des Drehimpulses (Quantenzahl l) und die z-Komponente des Drehimpuls (Quantenzahl m). Diese drei Größen bilden dann einen vollständigen Satz kommutierender Observablen.\n",
        "Eine Menge von Observablen A, B, C,... bildet einen v.S.k.O., wenn eine orthonormale Basis des Zustandsraums aus gemeinsamen Eigenvektoren der Observablen existiert, und diese Basis (bis auf einen Phasenfaktor) eindeutig ist.\n",

        "A mixed state and a product state are two different types of quantum states that arise in quantum mechanics and quantum information theory, each with its own distinct properties and interpretations.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Mixed State**: A mixed state describes a statistical mixture of different quantum states, each with a certain probability. Mathematically, a mixed state is represented by a density matrix, which is a positive-semidefinite Hermitian operator with trace 1. If a system is in a mixed state, it means we have some classical uncertainty about which specific quantum state it's in. For example, a system might be in state |0⟩ with probability 1/2 and in state |1⟩ with probability 1/2. This would correspond to the mixed state represented by the density matrix ρ = 1/2|0⟩⟨0| + 1/2|1⟩⟨1|.\n",

        "2. **Product State**: A product state refers to a state of a composite system that can be written as the tensor product of states of its subsystems. For example, if you have a two-qubit system and the first qubit is in state |0⟩ and the second qubit is in state |1⟩, the overall state of the system is the product state |0⟩⊗|1⟩, often written as |01⟩. A product state implies that there are no correlations between the subsystems, i.e., the subsystems are not entangled. If a state of a composite system cannot be written as a tensor product of states of its subsystems, it's called an entangled state.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, in summary, the difference lies in what each state represents: a mixed state represents classical uncertainty about which pure state a system is in, while a product state represents a separable (i.e., non-entangled) state of a composite system. Notably, these are not mutually exclusive: you can have a mixed state of product states, for example."

        "⚛ In quantum field theory, the concept of global phase in a one-qubit system can be understood in the context of symmetries, particularly the global U(1) phase symmetry. U(1) is a mathematical group that represents a continuous symmetry associated with global phase transformations. We can outline how quantum field theory incorporates this symmetry to explain the concept:\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Global U(1) Phase Symmetry:\n",
        "In quantum field theory, we work with fields and operators that are often complex-valued. The global U(1) phase symmetry refers to the ability to multiply the entire quantum state by a complex phase factor without affecting the physical observables. Mathematically, for a one-qubit system, the global U(1) phase transformation can be represented as follows:\n",
        "|ψ⟩ → e^(iθ)|ψ⟩ where, θ is a real number representing the phase transformation.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ No Observable Impact: The key feature of this global phase transformation is that it does not change the probabilities of measurement outcomes or any other physically observable quantities. The global phase is, in a sense, \"gauged out\" because it affects both the quantum state and its complex conjugate, so it cancels out in terms of probabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Conservation of Probability: The conservation of probability is ensured by the U(1) phase symmetry. The probabilities of measuring a qubit in any state remain constant under global phase transformations. This property is closely related to the conservation of probability in quantum systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Interference and Relative Phases: While the global phase itself is not physically meaningful, relative phases between different quantum states are significant. Quantum field theory allows for interference effects, which arise from relative phases between states. This interference is crucial in understanding phenomena like quantum entanglement and quantum superposition.\n",
        "\n",
        "✴ In summary, quantum field theory incorporates the global U(1) phase symmetry to explain the concept of global phase in a one-qubit system. This symmetry allows for phase transformations that do not affect the probabilities of measurement outcomes, highlighting the importance of relative phases in quantum interference effects and quantum phenomena.\n"

Instead of storing them as full 32-bit floating-point numbers, it's possible to represent them using lower-precision integers (e.g., 8-bit integers). This drastically reduces memory footprint and computational cost.\n",
        "* **Lora:** Lora (Low-Rank Adaptation) is a technique that decomposes weight matrices in LLMs into smaller, more manageable components. This decomposition can then be exploited during quantization for efficiency.\n",
        "* **CPU efficiency:**  By reducing the memory and computational requirements through quantization, it becomes feasible to train, or at least perform inference of, LLMs on CPUs, which are more generally available and cost-effective than GPUs in many scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Challenges and Considerations**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Accuracy trade-off:** Quantization generally leads to a slight loss in model accuracy compared to full-precision floating-point representations. The goal is to find the right balance between quantization level and acceptable performance.\n",

        "LoRA is probably the most widely used parameter-efficient finetuning method for LLMs and vision transformers, and DoRA can be seen as an improvement or extension of LoRA that is built on top of it.\n",
        "\n",
        "A brief LoRA recap: Assuming we have pretrained model weights W, LoRA uses low-rank matrices to approximate weight changes ΔW. I.e., in regular finetuning we have W' = W + ΔW, and in LoRA, we approximate ΔW with BA.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, the DoRA method first decomposes the pretrained weight matrix into a magnitude vector (m) and a directional matrix (V). Then, it takes the directional matrix V and applies standard LoRA to it, i.e., W' = m (V + ΔV)/norm = m (W + BA)/norm.\n",
        "\n",
        "The motivation for developing this method is based on analyzing and comparing the LoRA and full finetuning learning patterns. They found that LoRA either increases or decreases magnitude and direction updates proportionally but seems to lack the capability of making only subtle directional changes as found in full finetuning. Hence, the researchers propose the decoupling of magnitude and directional components. In other words, their DoRA method aims to apply LoRA only to the directional component (while also allowing the magnitude component to be trained separably.)\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that introducing the magnitude vector m in DoRA adds 0.01% more parameters than standard LoRA. However, across both LLM and vision transformer benchmarks, they found that DoRA even outperforms LoRA if the DoRA rank is halved, i.e., when DoRA only uses half the parameters of regular LoRA.\n",

        "\n",
        "Adapter tuning is a technique used to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) for new tasks more efficiently. Here's the core idea:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Pre-trained Models:** Large language models have been trained on vast amounts of text data, giving them a deep understanding of language patterns.\n",
        "* **Bottleneck:** Fine-tuning these massive models to a specific task (like question answering or translation) often means updating millions or billions of parameters, which is computationally expensive and time-consuming.\n",
        "* **Adapters to the Rescue:** Adapter tuning introduces compact \"adapter\" modules (small sets of new neural network layers) within the pre-trained model's architecture.  Instead of updating the entire model, only the parameters within these adapters are trained for the new task.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Advantages of Adapter Tuning**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Efficiency:** Adapter tuning greatly reduces the number of parameters needing updates, making fine-tuning significantly faster and less computationally demanding.\n",
        "* **Preserving Knowledge:** By freezing most of the original model's weights, adapter tuning preserves the language knowledge the model has acquired during pre-training.\n",
        "* **Multi-Task Learning:** A single pre-trained model can have multiple adapters, each trained for a different task. This allows the model to switch between tasks easily without needing to retrain the entire model.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How Adapter Tuning Works**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Pre-trained Model:** Start with a large, pre-trained language model.\n",
        "2. **Insert Adapters:** Add small adapter modules (new layers) between existing layers of the pre-trained model.\n",
        "3. **Freeze the Original Model:** Keep the weights of the pre-trained model frozen.\n",
        "4. **Train the Adapters:** Train only the parameters of the newly added adapters on the data for the specific task at hand.\n",
        "\n",
        "**In Summary**\n",

        "\n",
        "**How ASPIRE Finetunes LLMs:**\n",
        "\n",
        "ASPIRE involves finetuning a pre-trained LLM on a portion of question-answering datasets like CoQA. During finetuning, the model learns to output both an answer and a selection score. The selection score indicates the model's confidence in its answer.  This approach directly modifies the LLM's output behavior, aligning with finetuning.\n",

        "* Here's how RLHF is applied to LLMs:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**: Initially, the language model is trained on a large dataset of text from the internet. This phase is purely supervised learning, where the model learns to predict the next word in a sequence. However, this dataset might not perfectly represent desirable outputs, as it contains a wide range of materials, including low-quality or harmful content.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Reward Modeling**: After the initial training, human reviewers assess the outputs of the model, providing feedback on its responses. This feedback could be in the form of rankings, ratings, or direct corrections. This human feedback is then used to create a reward model. The reward model essentially predicts how a human would rate a given output, serving as a proxy for human judgment.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**: With the reward model in place, the LLM is further trained using reinforcement learning, specifically a method called Proximal Policy Optimization. In this phase, the model learns to generate outputs that are more likely to receive higher ratings from the reward model. This step is crucial for aligning the model's outputs with human values and preferences.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Iterative Refinement**: The process can be iterative, with further rounds of human feedback and model refinement. This ongoing interaction helps in continuously improving the quality and relevance of the model's responses, ensuring they align well with ethical guidelines, factual accuracy, and user expectations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Applying RLHF to LLMs is important for several reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Alignment with Human Values**: It helps ensure that the model's outputs are aligned with human ethical standards and societal norms.\n",
        "- **Reduction of Harmful Outputs**: By training the model with human feedback, it's possible to reduce the likelihood of generating unsafe, biased, or otherwise undesirable content.\n",
        "- **Enhanced Relevance and Utility**: Feedback-driven training can make the model more useful and relevant to users by focusing on generating high-quality, contextually appropriate responses.\n",

        "Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in the context of machine learning, and specifically for large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 or GPT-4, is an approach that focuses on optimizing the model's outputs based directly on human preferences. This method is a part of the broader framework of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Here's a closer look at how DPO works and its significance:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Collecting Human Preferences**: The first step in DPO involves gathering data on human preferences. This is typically done by presenting human reviewers with pairs of outputs generated by the model in response to the same prompt or query. The reviewers are then asked to indicate which of the two responses they prefer.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Training a Preference Model**: The collected preference data is used to train a preference model. This model learns to predict the likelihood of one output being preferred over another by humans. Essentially, it aims to understand and quantify what makes one response more favorable or acceptable than another.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Optimizing the Language Model**: Once the preference model is trained, it is used to guide the training of the language model. The language model is optimized to generate outputs that are more likely to align with the preferences indicated by humans. This optimization can be done using various techniques, including reinforcement learning algorithms.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Iterative Process**: Like other RLHF techniques, DPO is often iterative. The model's outputs can be continuously evaluated and compared by human reviewers, and the preference model can be updated based on new data. This leads to ongoing improvements in the language model's alignment with human preferences.\n",
        "\n",
        "The significance of DPO lies in its focus on aligning the model's outputs with what humans explicitly prefer. This is particularly important for applications where the quality of an output is subjective and can vary based on context and the specific needs or values of the user.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, in a conversational AI, different users might have different preferences for the style, tone, and type of responses they find engaging or helpful. DPO allows the model to be tuned to these preferences, potentially leading to more personalized and satisfactory interactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, Direct Preference Optimization represents a powerful method for increasing the alignment of AI systems with human values, preferences, and expectations, thereby enhancing their usefulness, safety, and acceptance in various applications."

The goal of additional training is always and exclusively to improve the quality of the results in a pass@1 fashion.  If you sample from pass@100, use additional compute to rank the results, and select the top 1% of generations for additional training, then you are increasingly biasing the model toward the highest quality results (which is the purpose of training).

        "Grounding in large language models (LLMs) refers to the process of connecting their responses to real-world entities and concepts. This is crucial for ensuring that LLMs generate accurate, relevant, and meaningful outputs. LLMs are trained on massive datasets of text and code, but this knowledge is often abstract and lacks specific context. Grounding allows LLMs to access and incorporate external information to make their responses more grounded in reality.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are several different approaches to grounding LLMs, but they typically involve some combination of the following techniques:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Knowledge base access:** LLMs can be connected to knowledge bases, such as Wikidata or Google Search, to access information about real-world entities and concepts. This information can be used to refine and improve their responses.\n",
        "* **Data retrieval:** LLMs can be used to retrieve relevant data from external sources, such as databases or web pages. This data can then be used to ground their responses in real-world context.\n",
        "* **Physical interaction:** In some cases, LLMs can be directly connected to the real world through sensors and actuators. This allows them to interact with their environment and gather information directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Grounding is an essential part of developing reliable and useful LLMs. By grounding their responses in real-world knowledge, LLMs can be more accurate, relevant, and informative. This makes them more suitable for a wider range of applications, such as question answering, summarization, and natural language generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are some of the benefits of grounding LLMs:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Improved accuracy:** Grounding can help to reduce the number of factual errors in LLM responses.\n",
        "* **Increased relevance:** Grounding can help to ensure that LLM responses are relevant to the context in which they are generated.\n",
        "* **Enhanced creativity:** Grounding can help LLMs to generate more creative and interesting text formats.\n",
        "* **Expanded capabilities:** Grounding can allow LLMs to perform tasks that require more knowledge of the real world, such as answering questions about physical entities or events.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, grounding is a powerful technique for improving the performance and usefulness of large language models. As LLMs continue to develop, grounding is likely to play an even more important role in their development and application."

        "1. **Retrieval:** When you ask a question, RAG first searches through a knowledge base (like Wikipedia, internal company documents, news articles, etc.) to find relevant passages of text.\n",
        "2. **Augmentation:** This relevant text is appended to your original question, creating a richer, more informative prompt.\n",
        "3. **Generation:** The LLM uses this combined information (original question + retrieved knowledge) to generate a more comprehensive and accurate answer.\n",

        "**Benefits of RAG**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Up-to-date Information:** RAG models aren't stuck with the knowledge they were trained on. They can access and integrate fresh information on demand.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Embedding Generation: The LLM takes a query (e.g., a piece of text or an image) and creates a vector representation of it.\n",
        "2. Vector Database: The LLM has a pre-computed database of vectors representing items like text passages, images, or code snippets.\n",
        "3. Similarity Calculation: The LLM calculates the similarity (often using cosine similarity) between the query vector and all the vectors in the database.\n",
        "4. Retrieval: The vectors with the highest similarity scores (closest distance to the query vector) are retrieved. These returned items are considered the most relevant matches to the original query.\n",

        "Applications - Vector retrieval (a.k.a. vector search) is a powerful tool used across various LLM-based applications:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Semantic Search: Searching for information based on meaning rather than just keywords.\n",
        "* Recommendation Systems: Recommending products, content, etc. based on a user's preferences and similarity between items.\n",

        "\n",
        "**ANN (Approximate Nearest Neighbor)**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Purpose:**  ANN algorithms are designed to find items (\"neighbors\") in a dataset that are most similar to a given query, even in very high-dimensional spaces. In LLM retrieval, the query would be the user's input, and the items in the dataset are potential text passages containing relevant information.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Role in LLM Retrieval:**\n",
        "    * **Efficiency:**  ANN is crucial for LLM-based retrieval because naively comparing a query to every piece of text in a large database would be extremely computationally expensive. ANN makes this process tremendously faster.\n",
        "    * **Understanding Similarity:** ANN focuses on finding passages that are semantically similar to the user's query, even if they don't contain exact keyword matches. This aligns well with LLMs' ability to understand nuanced meaning.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Types of ANN:** Several ANN algorithms exist (e.g., HNSW, FAISS), each with trade-offs in accuracy, speed, and memory usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "**MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance)**\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Purpose:** MMR is a ranking algorithm used to ensure diversity and avoid redundancy in search results. In LLM retrieval, it works after ANN has identified potential relevant passages.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Role in LLM Retrieval:**\n",
        "    * **Diversification of Results:** MMR aims to prevent the top results from all being too similar to each other. Instead, it promotes including passages that, while relevant, also cover different aspects or perspectives related to the query.\n",
        "    * **Improving User Experience:** This diversification helps the LLM provide a more comprehensive and informative set of responses to the user, reducing the likelihood of receiving repetitive information.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **User Query:** The user enters a query or question.\n",
        "2. **ANN Retrieval:** Using the ANN algorithm, a set of potentially relevant passages is efficiently retrieved from a large text corpus.\n",
        "3. **MMR Ranking:** MMR analyzes the retrieved passages and reranks them, prioritizing both relevance to the query and diversity within the results.\n",
        "4. **Return to LLM:** The top-ranked passages may be fed back into the LLM for further processing, allowing the LLM to generate a more informed and helpful response.\n",
