# Alexander Del Toro Barba, PhD

**Lead Machine Learning Specialist at Google**

Dr. Alexander Del Toro Barba is Lead Machine Learning Specialist at Google Cloud, where he supports business & industry solving their most challenging problems with machine learning.
In this role, Alexander worked on financial forecasting in finance, anomaly detection in predictive maintenance, prediction of chemical concentration in life sciences manufacturing, visual inspection of surfaces for quality control in automotive, entity recognition in natural language documents, and image segmentation in autonomous driving. **Since 2020 Alexander has been Practice Lead of the machine learning specialists in the Google Cloud** North region.

Besides, **Alexander contributed to DeepMind on a renewable energy project for wind power forecast optimization** to fight climate change, and to Google Research on machine learning for improved weather forecasting. Currently, Alexander is working in the context of a **20% role at Google Quantum AI research team in Munich**, and is part of a technical working group to explore applications for quantum computing with machine learning.

Alexander holds a PhD in Financial Forecasting from the University of MÃ¼nster in Germany, that he completed within 4 years besides his full time job at a financial asset manager in Frankfurt.
