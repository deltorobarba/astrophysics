This can perform significantly better than \"true\" stochastic gradient descent described, because the code can make use of vectorization libraries rather than computing each step separately. It may also result in smoother convergence, as the gradient computed at each step uses more training examples.\n",
        "* The convergence of stochastic gradient descent has been analyzed using the theories of convex minimization and of stochastic approximation. Briefly, when the learning rates decrease with an appropriate rate, and subject to relatively mild assumptions, stochastic gradient descent converges almost surely to a global minimum when the objective function is convex or pseudoconvex, and otherwise converges almost surely to a local minimum.[3][4] This is in fact a consequence of the Robbins-Siegmund theorem.\n",

Foremost is that it uses moving averages of the parameters (momentum); Bengio discusses the reasons for why this is beneficial in Section 3.1.1 of this paper. Simply put, this enables Adam to use a larger effective step size, and the algorithm will converge to this step size without fine tuning.\n",

A simple tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer could equally be used in your MLP, but would require more hyperparameter tuning before it would converge as quickly.\n",
        "* Learning rate decay? - ADAM updates any parameter with an individual learning rate. This means that every parameter in the network have a specific learning rate associated. But the single learning rate for parameter is computed using lambda (the initial learning rate) as upper limit. This means that every single learning rate can vary from 0 (no update) to lambda (maximum update). The learning rates adapt themselves during train steps.\n",

        "* In summary, RMSprop is an extension of Adagrad that deals with its radically diminishing learning rates. It is identical to Adadelta, except that Adadelta uses the RMS of parameter updates in the numinator update rule. Adam, finally, adds bias-correction and momentum to RMSprop. Insofar, RMSprop, Adadelta, and Adam are very similar algorithms that do well in similar circumstances. Kingma et al. [15] show that its bias-correction helps Adam slightly outperform RMSprop towards the end of optimization as gradients become sparser. Insofar, Adam might be the best overall choice.\n",
        "* Interestingly, many recent papers use vanilla SGD without momentum and a simple learning rate annealing schedule. As has been shown, SGD usually achieves to find a minimum, but it might take significantly longer than with some of the optimizers, is much more reliant on a robust initialization and annealing schedule, and may get stuck in saddle points rather than local minima. Consequently, if you care about fast convergence and train a deep or complex neural network, you should choose one of the adaptive learning rate methods.\n"
