        "* Especially used for models where we have to predict the probability as an output.\n",

        "**Disadvantages**\n",
        "* Saturated neurons “kill” the gradients (look at x= -10, 0 and 10). Can cause the neural network to get stuck during training. If a strongly-negative input is provided to the logistic sigmoid, it outputs values very near zero. Since neural networks usethe feed-forward activations to calculate parameter gradients, this can result in model parameters that are updated less regularly than we would like, and are thus “stuck” in their current state.\n",
        "* Sigmoid outputs are not zero-centered. Mean not at zero anymore. Consider what happens when the input to a neuron (x) is always positive. What can we say about the gradients on w? They are always all positive or all negative (and run zig-zag)! (this is also why you want zero-mean data!)\n",
